<TEI.2><text lang="en"><body><div1 n="1" type="book" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10" /><milestone unit="section" n="1" />We have next
					to speak of the number and quality of the propositions of which those syllogisms
					are constructed which have for their object accusation and defence. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Three things have to be considered; first, the nature
					and the number of the motives which lead men to act unjustly; secondly, what is
					the state of mind of those who so act; thirdly, the character and dispositions
					of those who are exposed to injustice. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />We will
					discuss these questions in order, after we have first defined acting unjustly.</p>
				<p>Let injustice, then, be defined as voluntarily causing injury contrary to the
					law. Now, the law is particular or general. By particular, I mean the written
					law in accordance with which a state is administered; by general, the unwritten
					regulations which appear to be universally recognized. Men act voluntarily when
					they know what they do, and do not act under compulsion. What is done
					voluntarily is not always done with premeditation; but what is done with
					premeditation is always known to the agent, for no one is ignorant of what he
					does with a purpose.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> （premeditation, deliberate or moral
						choice） is always voluntary, but all voluntary action is not
						premeditated; we sometimes act on the spur of the moment. Choice is a
						voluntary act, the result of deliberate counsel, including the use of reason
						and knowledge. In <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1113a" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
							11</bibl> Aristotle defines <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> as “a deliberate appetition of
						（longing for, <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign>）
						things in our power,” as to which we should necessarily be
						well-informed.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4" />The motives which lead men to do injury and
					commit wrong actions are depravity and incontinence. For if men have one or more
					vices, it is in that which makes him vicious that he shows himself unjust; for
					example, the illiberal in regard to money, the licentious in regard to bodily
					pleasures, the effeminate in regard to what makes for ease,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, “in the matter of ease,” taking
						<foreign lang="greek">τὰ ῥάθυμα</foreign> as = <foreign lang="greek">ῥαθυμία</foreign>.</note> the coward in regard to dangers, for fright
					makes him desert his comrades in peril;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />the ambitious in
					his desire for honor, the irascible owing to anger, one who is eager to conquer
					in his desire for victory, the rancorous in his desire for vengeance; the
					foolish man from having mistaken ideas of right and wrong, the shameless from
					his contempt for the opinion of others. Similarly, each of the rest of mankind
					is unjust in regard to his special weakness.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5" />This will be perfectly clear, partly from what
					has already been said about the virtues, and partly from what will be said about
					the emotions. It remains to state the motives and character of those who do
					wrong and of those who suffer from it. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />First,
					then, let us decide what those who set about doing wrong long for or avoid; for
					it is evident that the accuser must examine the number and nature of the motives
					which are to be found in his opponent; the defendant, which of them are not to
					be found in him. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Now, all human actions are
					either the result of man's efforts or not. Of the latter some are due to chance,
					others to necessity. Of those due to necessity, some are to be attributed to
					compulsion, others to nature, so that the things which men do not do of
					themselves are all the result of chance, nature, or compulsion. As for those
					which they do of themselves and of which they are the cause, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1369a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />some are the result of habit, others of
					longing, and of the latter some are due to rational, others to irrational
					longing. <milestone unit="section" n="8" />Now wish is a
					[rational] longing for good, for no one wishes for anything
					unless he thinks it is good; irrational longings are anger and desire. Thus all
					the actions of men must necessarily be referred to seven causes: chance, nature,
					compulsion, habit, reason, anger, and desire.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9" />But it is superfluous to establish further
					distinctions of men's acts based upon age, moral habits, or anything else. For
					if the young happen to be<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">In the cases of the
						young, the poor, and the rich, their youth etc. are only
						“accidents,” accidental not real causes. Aristotle
						defines <foreign lang="greek">τὸ συμβεβηκός</foreign> （<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1007a" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristot. Met. 4.30</bibl>） as
						“that which is inherent in something, and may be predicated of it
						as true, but neither necessarily, nor in most cases; for instance, if a man,
						when digging a hole for a plant, finds a treasure.” The color of a
						man's eyes is an “inseparable” accident, the fact that a
						man is a lawyer is a “separabIe” accident.</note>
					irascible, or passionately desire anything, it is not because of their youth
					that they act accordingly, but because of anger and desire. Nor is it because of
					wealth or poverty; but the poor happen to desire wealth because of their lack of
					it, and the rich desire unnecessary pleasures because they are able to procure
					them. Yet in their case too it will not be wealth or poverty, but desire, that
					will be the mainspring of their action. Similarly, the just and the unjust, and
					all the others who are said to act in accordance with their moral habits, will
					act from the same causes, either from reason or emotion, but some from good
					characters and emotions, and others from the opposite. <milestone unit="section" n="10" />Not but that it does happen<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />that such and
					such moral habits are followed by such and such consequences; for it may be that
					from the outset the fact of being temperate produces in the temperate man good
					opinions and desires in the matter of pleasant things, in the intemperate man
					the contrary. <milestone unit="section" n="11" />Therefore we must leave these
					distinctions on one side, but we must examine what are the usual consequences of
					certain conditions. For, if a man is fair or dark, tall or short, there is no
					rule that any such consequences should follow, but if he is young or old, just
					or unjust, it does make a difference. In a word, it will be necessary to take
					account of all the circumstances that make men's characters different; for
					instance, if a man fancies himself rich or poor, fortunate or unfortunate, it
					will make a difference. We will, however, discuss this later<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book 2.12-18.</note>; let us now speak of what remains to be
					said here.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12" />Things which are the result of chance are all
					those of which the cause is indefinite, those which happen without any end in
					view, and that neither always, nor generally, nor regularly. The definition of
					chance will make this clear. <milestone unit="section" n="13" />Things which are
					the result of nature are all those of which the cause is in themselves and
					regular; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1369b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />for they turn out
					always, or generally, in the same way. As for those which happen contrary to
					nature there is no need to investigate minutely whether their occurrence is due
					to a certain force of nature or some other cause <milestone unit="section" n="14" />（it would seem, however, that such cases also are due to
					chance）. Those things are the result of compulsion which are done by
					the agents themselves in opposition to their desire or calculation. <milestone unit="section" n="15" />Things are the result of habit, when they are done
					because they have often been done. <milestone unit="section" n="16" />Things are
					the result of calculation which are done because, of the goods already
					mentioned, they appear to be expedient either as an end or means to an end,
					provided they are done by reason of their being expedient; for even the
					intemperate do certain things that are expedient, for the sake, not of
					expediency, but of pleasure. Passion and anger are the causes of acts of
					revenge. <milestone unit="section" n="17" />But there is a difference between
					revenge and punishment; the latter is inflicted in the interest of the sufferer,
					the former in the interest of him who inflicts it, that he may obtain
					satisfaction. <milestone unit="section" n="18" />We will define anger when we
					come to speak of the emotions.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book
						2.2.</note> Desire is the cause of things being done that are apparently
					pleasant. The things which are familiar and to which we have become accustomed
					are among pleasant things; for men do with pleasure many things which are not
					naturally pleasant, when they have become accustomed to them.</p>
				<p>In short, all things that men do of themselves either are, or seem,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />good or pleasant; and since men do voluntarily what they
					do of themselves, and involuntarily what they do not, it follows that all that
					men do voluntarily will be either that which is or seems good, or that which is
					or seems pleasant. For I reckon among good things the removal of that which is
					evil or seems evil, or the exchange of a greater evil for a less, because these
					two things are in a way desirable; in like manner, I reckon among pleasant
					things the removal of that which is or appears painful, and the exchange of a
					greater pain for a less. We must therefore make ourselves acquainted with the
					number and quality of expedient and pleasant things. <milestone unit="section" n="19" />We have already spoken of the expedient when discussing deliberative
					rhetoric<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Cf. Book 1.6 above.</note>; let
					us now speak of the pleasant. And we must regard our definitions as sufficient
					in each case, provided they are neither obscure nor too precise.</p>
