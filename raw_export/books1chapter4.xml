<TEI.2><text lang="en"><body><div1 n="1" type="book" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4" /><milestone unit="section" n="1" />We must first
					ascertain about what kind of good or bad things the deliberative orator advises,
					since he cannot do so about everything, but only about things which may possibly
					happen or not. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Everything which of necessity
					either is or will be, or which cannot possibly be or come to pass, is outside
					the scope of deliberation. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Indeed, even in the
					case of things that are possible advice is not universally appropriate; for they
					include certain advantages, natural and accidental, about which it is not worth
					while to offer advice. But it is clear that advice is limited to those subjects
					about which we take counsel; and such are all those which can naturally be
					referred to ourselves and the first cause of whose origination is in our own
					power; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1359b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />for our examination is
					limited to finding out whether such things are possible or impossible for us to
					perform.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4" />However, there is no need at present to endeavor
					to enumerate with scrupulous exactness or to classify those subjects which men
					are wont to discuss, or to define them as far as possible with strict accuracy,
					since this is not the function of the rhetorical art but of one that is more
					intelligent and exact, and further, more than its legitimate subjects of inquiry
					have already been assigned to it. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />For what we
					have said before is true<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The analytical
						science is Dialectic, incorrectly regarded as a branch of Analytics, which
						properly implies scientific demonstration.</note>: that Rhetoric is composed
					of analytical science and of that branch of political science which is concerned
					with Ethics, and that it resembles partly Dialectic and partly sophistical
					arguments. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />But in proportion as anyone
					endeavors to make of Dialectic or Rhetoric, not what they are, faculties, but
					sciences, to that extent he will, without knowing it, destroy their real nature,
					in thus altering their character, by crossing over into the domain of
					sciences<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Taking <foreign lang="greek">εἰς
						ἐπιστήμας</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">μεταβαίνειν</foreign>.
						If taken with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισκευάζων</foreign>, the sense will
						be: “by changing his ground （ <foreign lang="greek">μεταβαίνειν</foreign> being used absolutely） while altering
						their characters from faculties to sciences.”</note>, whose
					subjects are certain definite things, not merely words. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Nevertheless, even at present we may mention such
					matters as it is worth while to analyze, while still leaving much for political
					science to investigate.</p>
				<p>Now, we may say that the most important subjects about which all men
					deliberate<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />and deliberative orators harangue, are
					five in number, to wit: ways and means, war and peace, the defence of the
					country, imports and exports, legislation.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8" />Accordingly, the orator who is going to give
					advice on ways and means should be acquainted with the nature and extent of the
					State resources, so that if any is omitted it may be added, and if any is
					insufficient, it may be increased. Further, he should know all the expenses of
					the State, that if any is superfluous, it may be removed, or, if too great, may
					be curtailed. For men become wealthier, not only by adding to what they already
					possess, but also by cutting down expenses. Of these things it is not only
					possible to acquire a general view from individual experience, but in view of
					advising concerning them it is further necessary to be well informed about what
					has been discovered among others.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9" />In regard to war and peace, the orator should be
					acquainted with the power of the State, how great it is already and how great it
					may possibly become; of what kind it is already and what additions may possibly
					be made to it; further, what wars it has waged and its conduct of them. These
					things he should be acquainted with, not only as far as his own State is
					concerned, but also in reference to neighboring States, and particularly those
					with whom there is a likelihood of war, so that towards the stronger a pacific
					attitude may be maintained, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1360a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />and in regard to the weaker, the decision as to making war on them may be left
					to his own State. Again, he should know whether their forces are like or unlike
					his own, for herein also advantage or disadvantage may lie. With reference to
					these matters he must also have examined the results, not only of the wars
					carried on by his own State, but also of those carried on by others; for similar
					results naturally arise from similar causes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10" />Again, in regard to the defense of the country,
					he should not be ignorant how it is carried on; he should know both the strength
					of the guard, its character, and the positions of the guard-houses
					（which is impossible for one who is unacquainted with the
					country）, so that if any guard is insufficient it may be increased, or
					if any is superfluous it may be disbanded, and greater attention devoted to
					suitable positions.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11" />Again, in regard to food, he should know what
					amount of expenditure is sufficient to support the State; what kind of food is
					produced at home or can be imported; and what exports and imports are necessary,
					in order that contracts and agreements may be made with those<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">τούτους</foreign>: those who will
						receive exports and send imports.</note> who can furnish them; for it is
					necessary to keep the citizens free from reproach in their relations with two
					classes of people—those who are stronger and those who are useful for
					commercial purposes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12" />With a view to the safety of the State, it is
					necessary that the orator should be able to judge of all these questions, but an
					understanding of legislation is of special importance, for it is on the laws<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />that the safety of the State is based. Wherefore he must
					know how many forms of government there are; what is expedient for each; and the
					natural causes of its downfall, whether they are peculiar to the particular form
					of government or opposed to it. By being ruined by causes peculiar to itself, I
					mean that, with the exception of the perfect form of government, all the rest
					are ruined by being relaxed or strained to excess. Thus democracy, not only when
					relaxed, but also when strained to excess, becomes weaker and will end in an
					oligarchy; similarly, not only does an aquiline or snub nose reach the mean,
					when one of these defects is relaxed, but when it becomes aquiline or snub to
					excess, it is altered to such an extent that even the likeness of a nose is
					lost. <milestone unit="section" n="13" />Moreover, with reference to acts of
					legislation, it is useful not only to understand what form of government is
					expedient by judging in the light of the past, but also to become acquainted
					with those in existence in other nations, and to learn what kinds of government
					are suitable to what kinds of people. It is clear, therefore, that for
					legislation books of travel are useful, since they help us to understand the
					laws of other nations, and for political debates historical works.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">This rendering, although convenient, hardly
						represents the Greek, which, literally translated, is “the
						<emph>investigations</emph> of those who write about human
						actions” （cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἱστορικός</foreign>, 4.8）.</note> All these things, however,
					belong to Politics and not to Rhetoric.</p>
				<p>Such, then, are the most important questions upon which the would-be deliberative
					orator <pb ed="Bekker" n="1360b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />must be well informed.
					Now let us again state the sources whence we must derive our arguments for
					exhortation or discussion on these and other questions.</p>
