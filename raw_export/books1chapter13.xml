					classify just and unjust actions generally, starting from what follows. Justice
					and injustice have been defined in reference to laws and persons in two ways.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2" />Now there are two kinds of laws, particular
					and general. By particular laws I mean those established by each people in
					reference to themselves, which again are divided into written and unwritten; by
					general laws I mean those based upon nature. In fact, there is a general idea of
					just and unjust in accordance with nature, as all men in a manner divine, even
					if there is neither communication nor agreement between them. This is what
					Antigone in Sophocles<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><bibl n="Soph. Ant. 456" default="NO" valid="yes">Soph. Ant. 456</bibl>.</note> evidently means, when she declares that
					it is just, though forbidden, to bury Polynices, as being naturally just: <quote>

							<l>For neither to-day nor yesterday, but from all eternity, these
								statutes live and no man knoweth whence they came.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> And as Empedocles says in regard to not killing that which has life,
					for this is not right for some and wrong for others, <quote>
						<lg type="dact" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>But a universal precept, which extends without a break throughout the
								wide-ruling sky and the boundless earth.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Alcidamas<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Of <placeName key="perseus,Elis" authname="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, pupil of Gorgias. The oration is
						not extant, but the scholiast supplies his words: <foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθέρους ἀφῆκε πάντας θεός: οὐδένα δοῦλον ἡ φύσις
							πεποίηκεν</foreign> （“God has left all men free;
						Nature has made none a slave”）. The Messenians had
						revolted from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" authname="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</note>
					also speaks of this precept in his <title>Messeniacus</title>. . . . <milestone unit="section" n="3" />And in relation to persons, there is a twofold
					division of law; for what one ought to do or ought not to do is concerned<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />with the community generally, or one of its members.</p>
				<p>Therefore there are two kinds of just and unjust acts, since they can be
					committed against a definite individual or against the community; he who commits
					adultery or an assault is guilty of wrong against a definite individual, he who
					refuses to serve in the army of wrong against the State. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />All kinds of wrong acts having been thus
					distinguished, some of which affect the State, others one or several
					individuals, let us repeat the definition of being wronged,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">1.10.3.</note> and then go on to the rest. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Being wronged is to suffer injustice at the hands of
					one who voluntarily inflicts it, for it has been established that injustice is a
					voluntary act. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />And since the man who suffers
					injustice necessarily sustains injury and that against his will, it is evident
					from what has been said in what the injuries consist; for things good and bad
					have already been distinguished in themselves,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book 1.6.</note> and it has been said that voluntary acts are all such as
					are committed with knowledge of the case.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">1.10.3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7" />Hence it necessarily follows that all
					accusations concern the State or the individual, the accused having acted either
					ignorantly and against his will, or voluntarily and with knowledge, and in the
					latter case with malice aforethought or from passion. <milestone unit="section" n="8" />We will speak of anger when we come to treat of the passions,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book 2.2.</note> and we have already
					stated<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book 1.11, 12.</note> in what
					circumstances and with what dispositions men act with deliberate purpose.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9" />But since a man, while admitting the fact, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1374a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />often denies the description
					of the charge or the point on which it turns—for instance, admits that
					he took something, but did not steal it; that he was the first to strike, but
					committed no outrage; that he had relations, but did not commit adultery, with a
					woman; or that he stole something but was not guilty of sacrilege, since the
					object in question was not consecrated; or that he trespassed, but not on public
					land; or that he held converse with the enemy, but was not guilty of
					treason—for this reason it will be necessary that a definition should
					be given of theft, outrage, or adultery, in order that, if we desire to prove
					that an offence has or has not been committed, we may be able to put the case in
					a true light. <milestone unit="section" n="10" />In all such instances the
					question at issue is to know whether the supposed offender is a wrongdoer and a
					worthless person, or not; for vice and wrongdoing consist in the moral purpose,
					and such terms as outrage and theft further indicate purpose; for if a man has
					struck, it does not in all cases follow that he has committed an outrage, but
					only if he has struck with a certain object, for instance, to bring disrepute
					upon the other or to please himself. Again, if a man has taken something by
					stealth, it is by no means certain that he has committed theft, but only if he
					has taken it to injure another<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Roemer reads,
						after Dittmeyer, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ [τούτου
							ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἔλαβε] καὶ</foreign> . . . from the old Latin
						translation</note> or to get something for himself. It is the same in all
					other cases as in these.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11" />We have said that there are two kinds of just
					and unjust actions （for some are written, but others are
					unwritten）,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />and have spoken of those
					concerning which the laws are explicit; of those that are unwritten there are
					two kinds. <milestone unit="section" n="12" />One kind arises from an excess of
					virtue or vice, which is followed by praise or blame, honor or dishonor, and
					rewards; for instance, to be grateful to a benefactor, to render good for good,
					to help one's friends, and the like;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Laws are
						special and general, the former being written or unwritten. The unwritten
						law, again, is of two kinds: （1） general;
						（2） supplementary to the special written law. This general
						law （not the same as the general law “based upon
						nature” sect. 2） refers to acts which go beyond the legal
						standard of virtuous or vicious acts and are characterized by a remarkable
						degree （ <foreign lang="greek">καθ᾽ ὑπερβολήν</foreign>）
						of virtue or the opposite. For these laws do not prescribe any special
						reward or punishment, but acts are praised or blamed, honored or dishonored,
						rewarded or punished, in accordance with the general feeling of
						mankind.</note> the other kind contains what is omitted in the special written
					law. <milestone unit="section" n="13" />For that which is equitable seems to be
					just, and equity is justice that goes beyond the written law. These omissions
					are sometimes involuntary, sometimes voluntary, on the part of the legislators;
					involuntary when it may have escaped their notice, voluntary when, being unable
					to define for all cases, they are obliged to make a universal statement, which
					is not applicable to all, but only to most, cases; and whenever it is difficult
					to give a definition owing to the infinite number of cases,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">“Inexperience”
						（Jebb）.</note> as, for instance, the size and kind of an iron
					instrument used in wounding; for life would not be long enough to reckon all the
					possibilities. <milestone unit="section" n="14" />If then no exact definition is
					possible, but legislation is necessary, one must have recourse to general terms;
					so that, if a man wearing a ring lifts up his hand to strike or actually
					strikes, according to the written law he is guilty of wrongdoing, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1374b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />but in reality he is not; and
					this is a case for equity.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15" />If then our definition of equity is correct, it
					is easy to see what things and persons are equitable or not. <milestone unit="section" n="16" />Actions which should be leniently treated are cases
					for equity; errors, wrong acts, and misfortunes, must not be thought deserving
					of the same penalty. Misfortunes are all such things as are unexpected and not
					vicious; errors are not unexpected, but are not vicious; wrong acts are such as
					might be expected and vicious, for acts committed through desire arise from
					vice. <milestone unit="section" n="17" />And it is equitable to pardon human
					weaknesses, and to look, not to the law but to the legislator; not to the letter
					of the law but to the intention of the legislator; not to the action itself, but
					to the moral purpose; <milestone unit="section" n="18" />not to the part, but to
					the whole; not to what a man is now, but to what he has been, always or
					generally; to remember good rather than ill treatment, and benefits received
					rather than those conferred; to bear injury with patience; to be willing to
					appeal to the judgement of reason rather than to violence;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">“To be willing that a judicial sentence should be
						nominal rather than real”
						（Jebb）.</note><milestone unit="section" n="19" />to
					prefer<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />arbitration to the law court, for the
					arbitrator keeps equity in view, whereas the dicast looks only to the law, and
					the reason why arbitrators were appointed was that equity might prevail. Let
					this manner of defining equity suffice.</p>
