                    Rhetoric then may be defined as the faculty of discovering the possible means of persuasion in
                    reference to any subject whatever. This is the function of no other of the arts,
                    each of which is able to instruct and persuade in its own special subject; thus,
                    medicine deals with health and sickness, geometry with the properties of
                    magnitudes, arithmetic with number, and similarly with all the other arts and
                    sciences. But Rhetoric, so to say, appears to be able to discover the means of
                    persuasion in reference to any given subject. That is why we say that as an art
                    its rules are not applied to any particular definite class of things.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As for proofs, some are artificial, others
                    inartificial. By the latter I understand all those which have not been furnished
                    by ourselves but were already in existence, such as witnesses, tortures,
                    contracts, and the like; by the former, all that can be constructed by system
                    and by our own efforts. Thus we have only to make use of the latter, whereas we
                    must invent the former.

                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now the proofs furnished by the speech are of
                    three kinds. The first depends upon the moral character of the speaker, the
                    second upon putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind, the third upon the
                    speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The orator persuades by moral character when his
                    speech is delivered in such a manner as to render him worthy of confidence; for
                    we feel confidence in a greater degree and more readily in persons of worth in
                    regard to everything in general, but where there is no certainty and there is
                    room for doubt, our confidence is absolute. But this confidence must be due to
                    the speech itself, not to any preconceived idea of the speaker's character; for
                    it is not the case, as some writers of rhetorical treatises lay down in their
                    “Art,” that the worth of the orator in no way contributes to
                    his powers of persuasion; on the contrary, moral character, so to say,
                    constitutes the most effective means of proof.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The orator persuades
                    by means of his hearers, when they are roused to emotion
                    by his speech; for the judgements we deliver are not the same when we are
                    influenced by joy or sorrow, love or hate; and it is to this alone that, as we
                    have said, the present-day writers of treatises endeavor to devote their
                    attention. （We will discuss these matters in detail when we come to
                    speak of the emotions.）<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Lastly,
                    persuasion is produced by the speech itself, when we establish the true<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or
                    apparently true from the means of persuasion
                    applicable to each individual subject.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now, since proofs are effected by these means,
                    it is evident that, to be able to grasp them, a man must be capable of logical
                    reasoning, of studying characters and the virtues, and thirdly the
                    emotions—the nature and character of each, its origin, and the manner
                    in which it is produced. Thus it appears that Rhetoric is as it were an offshoot
                    of Dialectic and of the science of Ethics, which may be reasonably called
                    Politics.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Rhetoric, as dealing with human
                        actions, characters, virtues, and emotions, is closely connected with
                        Politics, which includes Ethics. The two latter treat of the same subject
                        from a different point of view. Both deal with happiness and virtue, but the
                        object of Politics is, by comparison of the different forms of States to
                        find the one in which man will be most virtuous. Lastly, Rhetoric, as an
                        important factor in the training and education of the individual citizen and
                        of the members of the State as a whole, may be described as an offshoot of
                        Politics, with which the sophistical rhetoricians

                    claim to possess it, partly from ignorance, partly from boastfulness, and partly
                    from other human weaknesses, do the same. For, as we said at the outset,
                    Rhetoric is a sort of division or likeness of Dialectic, since neither of them
                    is a science that deals with the nature of any definite subject, but they are
                    merely faculties of furnishing arguments. We have now said nearly enough about
                    the faculties of these arts and their mutual relations.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But for purposes of demonstration, real or
                    apparent, just as Dialectic possesses two modes of argument,
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1356b"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>induction and the syllogism, real or
                    apparent, the same is the case in Rhetoric; for the example is induction, and
                    the enthymeme a syllogism, and the apparent enthymeme an apparent syllogism.
                    Accordingly I call an enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, and an example
                    rhetorical induction. Now all orators produce belief by employing as proofs
                    either examples or enthymemes and nothing else; so that if, generally speaking,
                    it is necessary to prove any fact whatever either by syllogism or by
                    induction—and that this is so is clear from the

                    induction, it has previously been said that the proof from a number of
                    particular cases that such is the rule, is called in Dialectic induction, in
                    Rhetoric example; but when, certain things being posited, something different
                    results by reason of them, alongside of them, from their being true, either
                    universally or in most cases, such a conclusion in Dialectic is called a
                    syllogism, in Rhetoric an enthymeme.

                    this case—for rhetorical speeches are sometimes characterized by

                    distinguished by their fondness for one or the other. Now arguments that depend
                    on examples are not less calculated to persuade, but those which depend upon

                    persons （for this is a matter that comes within the province of an art,
                    whereas the particular is infinite and cannot be the subject of a true
                    science）; similarly, therefore, Rhetoric will not consider what seems
                    probable in each individual case, for instance to

                    that class of persons. It is the same with Dialectic, which does not draw
                    conclusions from any random premises—for even madmen have some
                    fancies—but it takes its material from subjects which demand reasoned
                    discussion, as Rhetoric does from those which are common subjects of
                    deliberation.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The function of Rhetoric, then, is to deal with
                    things about which we deliberate, but for which we have no systematic rules; and
                    in the presence of such hearers as are unable to take a general view of many
                    stages, or to follow a lengthy chain of argument. But we only deliberate about
                    things which seem to admit of issuing in two ways; as for those things which
                    cannot in the past, present, or future be otherwise, no one deliberates about
                    them, if he supposes that they are such; for nothing would be gained by it.

                    and inferences partly from what has been previously demonstrated

                    because it does not depend upon what is either admitted or probable. The
                    necessary result then is that the enthymeme and the example are concerned with
                    things which may, generally speaking, be other than they are, the example being
                    a kind of induction and the enthymeme a kind of syllogism, and deduced from few

                    from which enthymemes are derived will be sometimes necessary, but for the most
                    part only generally true; and these materials being probabilities and signs, it
                    follows that these two elements must correspond to these two kinds of
                    propositions, each to each.

                    particular statement is true, it can be refuted, because it cannot be reduced to
                    syllogistic form. But if one were to say that it is a sign that a man is ill,
                    because he has a fever, or that a woman has had a child because she has milk,
                    this is a necessary sign. This alone among signs is a

                    the argument irrefutable. Other signs are related as the universal to the
                    particular, for instance, if one were to say that it is a sign that this man has
                    a fever, because he breathes hard; but even if the fact be true,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>this
                    argument also can be refuted, for it is possible for a man to
                    breathe hard without having a fever. We have now explained the meaning of
                    probable, sign, and necessary sign, and the difference between them; in the

                    same genus, but one of them is better known than the other. For example, to
                    prove that Dionysius is aiming at a tyranny, because he asks for a bodyguard,
                    one might say that Pisistratus before him and Theagenes of <placeName key="tgn,7017133"

                    serve as an example of Dionysius, whose reason, however, for asking for a
                    bodyguard we do not yet know. All these examples are contained under the same
                    universal proposition, that one who is aiming at a tyranny asks for a bodyguard.

                    in the dialectical method of syllogisms. For some of them belong to Rhetoric,
                    some syllogisms only to Dialectic, and others to other arts and faculties, some
                    already existing and others not yet established. Hence it is that this escapes
                    the notice of the speakers, and the more they specialize in a subject, the more
                    they transgress the limits of Rhetoric and Dialectic. But this will be clearer

                    those which are concerned with what we call “topics,” which

                    differ in kind, such as the topic of the more or less, which will furnish
                    syllogisms and enthymemes equally well for Law, Physics, or any other science
                    whatever, although these subjects differ in kind. Specific topics on the other
                    hand are derived from propositions which are peculiar to each species or genus
                    of things; there are, for example, propositions about Physics which can furnish

                    are propositions concerned with Ethics which will be useless for furnishing

                    the specific topics, the happier a man is in his choice of propositions, the
                    more he will unconsciously produce a science quite different from Dialectic and
                    Rhetoric. For if once he hits upon first principles, it will no longer be
                    Dialectic or Rhetoric, but that science whose principles he has arrived at.
