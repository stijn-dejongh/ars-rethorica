					then, what things, likely to happen or already existing, the orator should aim
					at, when exhorting, and what when dissuading; for they are opposites. But since
					the aim before the deliberative orator is that which is expedient, and men
					deliberate, not about the end, but about the means to the end, which are the
					things which are expedient in regard to<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />our actions; and
					since, further, the expedient is good, we must first grasp the elementary
					notions of good and expedient in general.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2" />Let us assume good to be whatever is desirable
					for its own sake, or for the sake of which we choose something else; that which
					is the aim of all things, or of all things that possess sensation or reason; or
					would be, if they could acquire the latter. Whatever reason might assign to each
					and whatever reason does assign to each in individual cases, that is good for
					each; and that whose presence makes a man fit and also independent; and
					independence in general; and that which produces or preserves such things, or on
					which such things follow, or all that is likely to prevent or destroy their
					opposites.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3" />Now things follow in two
					ways—simultaneously or subsequently; for instance, knowledge is
					subsequent to learning, but life is simultaneous with health. Things which
					produce act in three ways; thus, healthiness produces health; and so does food;
					and exercise as a rule. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />This being laid down,
					it necessarily follows that the acquisition of good things and the loss of evil
					things are both good; for it follows simultaneously on the latter that we are
					rid of that which is bad, and subsequently on the former that we obtain
					possession of that which is good. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />The same
					applies to the acquisition of a greater in place of a less good, and a less in
					place of a greater evil; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1362b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />for
					in proportion as the greater exceeds the less, there is an acquisition of the
					one and a loss of the other. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />The virtues also
					must be a good thing; for those who possess them are in a sound condition, and
					they are also productive of good things and practical. However, we must speak
					separately concerning each—what it is, and of what kind. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Pleasure also must be a good; for all living creatures
					naturally desire it. Hence it follows that both agreeable and beautiful things
					must be good; for the former produce pleasure, while among beautiful things some
					are pleasant and others are desirable in themselves.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8" />To enumerate them one by one, the following
					things must necessarily be good. Happiness, since it is desirable in itself and
					self-sufficient, and to obtain it we choose a number of things. <milestone unit="section" n="9" />Justice, courage, self-control, magnanimity,
					magnificence, and all other similar states of mind, for they are virtues of the
					soul. <milestone unit="section" n="10" />Health, beauty, and the like, for they
					are virtues of the body and produce many advantages; for instance, health is
					productive of pleasure and of life, wherefore it is thought to be best of all,
					because it is the cause of two things which the majority of men prize most
					highly. <milestone unit="section" n="11" />Wealth, since it is the excellence of
					acquisition<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The excellence of anything is
						proportionate to its success in the performance of its proper function. The
						function of acquisition is to get something valuable, such as money, and its
						“excellence” may be judges by the amount of wealth
						obtained.</note> and productive of many things.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" /><milestone unit="section" n="12" />A friend and friendship, since a friend
					is desirable in himself and produces many advantages. <milestone unit="section" n="13" />Honor and good repute, since they are agreeable and produce many
					advantages, and are generally accompanied by the possession of those things for
					which men are honored. <milestone unit="section" n="14" />Eloquence and capacity
					for action; for all such faculties are productive of many advantages. <milestone unit="section" n="15" />Further, natural cleverness, good memory, readiness
					to learn, quick-wittedness, and all similar qualities; for these faculties are
					productive of advantages. The same applies to all the sciences, arts, and even
					life, for even though no other good should result from it, <milestone unit="section" n="16" />it is desirable in itself. Lastly, justice, since it
					is expedient in general for the common weal.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17" />These are nearly all the things generally
					recognized as good; <milestone unit="section" n="18" />in the case of doubtful
					goods, the arguments in their favor are drawn from the following. That is good
					the opposite of which is evil, <milestone unit="section" n="19" />or the opposite
					of which is advantageous to our enemies; for instance, if it is specially
					advantageous to our enemies that we should be cowards, it is clear that courage
					is specially advantageous to the citizens. <milestone unit="section" n="20" />And, speaking generally, the opposite of what our enemies desire or of that in
					which they rejoice, appears to be advantageous; wherefore it was well said: <quote>
						<lg type="dact" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>Of a truth Priam would exult.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.255" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. Il.1.255</bibl>. The words are those
								of Nestor to Achilles and Agamemnon, in which he points out how
								their enemies would rejoice if they heard all the story of their
								quarrel.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> This is not always the case, but only as a general rule, for there is
					nothing to prevent one and the same thing being sometimes advantageous to two
					opposite parties; hence it is said that misfortune brings men together, when a
					common danger threatens them. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1363a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21" />That which is not in excess<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Reading <foreign lang="greek">ὅ</foreign>. The ordinary
					reading <foreign lang="greek">οὗ</foreign> is taken to mean
					“that which does not permit excess,” that which is
					midway between two extremes, the mean. Another suggested rendering is,
					“that of which one cannot have too much.”</note> is
					good, whereas that which is greater than it should be, is bad. <milestone unit="section" n="22" />And that which has cost much labor and expense, for
					it at once is seen to be an apparent good, and such a thing is regarded as an
					end, and an end of many efforts; now, an end is a good. Wherefore it was said: <quote>
						<lg type="dact" org="uniform" sample="complete">

					</quote> and the proverb, “[to break] the pitcher at
					the door.”<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Proverbial for

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="23" />And that which many aim at and which is seen to
					be competed for by many; for that which all aim at was recognized as a good, and
					the majority may almost stand for “all.” <milestone unit="section" n="24" />And that which is the object of praise, for no one
					praises that which is not good. And that which is praised by enemies; for if
					even those who are injured by it acknowledge its goodness, this amounts to a
					universal recognition of it; for it is because of its goodness being evident
					that they acknowledge it, just as those whom their enemies praise are
					worthless.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Meaning that they cannot have
						done their duty against their enemies, who would then have blamed them.
						Another suggested reading is <foreign lang="greek">οὓς οἱ φίλοι ψέγουσι
							καὶ οὓς οἱ ἐχθροὶ μὴ ψέγουσι</foreign>
						（“those whom their friends blame and whom their enemies
						do not blame.”）</note> Wherefore the Corinthians imagined
					themselves insulted by Simonides, when he wrote, <quote>

					<milestone unit="section" n="25" />And that which one of the practically wise or
					good, man or woman, has chosen before others, as Athene chose Odysseus, Theseus
					Helen, the goddesses Alexander <persName><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName>, and Homer Achilles.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26" />And, generally speaking, all that is
					deliberately chosen is good.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />Now, men deliberately choose
					to do the things just mentioned, and those which are harmful to their enemies,
					and advantageous to their friends, and things which are possible. <milestone unit="section" n="27" />The last are of two kinds: things which might
					happen,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">γενόμενα
						ἄν</foreign>: Spengel omits <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign>: i.e.
						“things which <emph>have</emph> happened.”</note> and
					things which easily happen; by the latter are meant things that happen without
					labor or in a short time, for difficulty is defined by labor or length of time.
					And anything that happens as men wish is good; and what they wish is either what
					is not evil at all or is less an evil than a good, which will be the case for
					instance, whenever the penalty attached to it is unnoticed or light. <milestone unit="section" n="28" />And things that are peculiar to them, or which no one
					else possesses,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"> “Or which no one
						else has done” （Jebb）.</note> or which are out
					of the common; for thus the honor is greater. And things which are appropriate
					to them; such are all things befitting them in respect of birth and power. And
					things which they think they lack, however unimportant; for none the less they
					deliberately choose to acquire them. <milestone unit="section" n="29" />And
					things which are easy of accomplishment, for being easy they are possible; such
					things are those in which all, or most men, or those who are equals or inferiors
					have been successful. And things whereby they will gratify friends or incur the
					hatred of enemies. And all things that those whom they admire deliberately
					choose to do. And those things in regard to which they are clever naturally or
					by experience; for they hope to be more easily successful in them. And things
					which no worthless man would approve, for that makes them the more commendable.
					And things which they happen to desire, for such things seem not only agreeable,
					but also better. <milestone unit="section" n="30" />Lastly, and above all, each
					man thinks those things good which are the object of his special desire, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1363b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />as victory of the man who
					desires victory, honor of the ambitious man, money of the avaricious, and so in
					other instances. These then are the materials from which we must draw our
					arguments in reference to good and the expedient.</p>
