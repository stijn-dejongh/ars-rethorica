<TEI.2><text lang="en"><body><div1 n="1" type="book" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7" /><milestone unit="section" n="1" />But since men
					often agree that both of two things are useful, but dispute which is the more
					so, we must next speak of the greater good and the more expedient. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Let one thing, then, be said to exceed another, when
					it is as great and something more—and to be exceeded when it is
					contained in the other. “Greater” and
					“more” always imply a relation with less;
					“great” and “small,”
					“much” and “little” with the general
					size of things; the “great” is that which exceeds, and that
					which falls short of it is “small”; and similarly
					“much” and “little.” <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Since, besides, we call good that which is desirable
					for its own sake and not for anything else, and that which all things aim at and
					which they would choose if they possessed reason and practical wisdom; and that
					which is productive or protective of good, or on which such things follow; and
					since that for the sake of which anything is done is the end, and the end is
					that for the sake of which everything else is done, and that is good for each
					man which relatively to him presents all these conditions, it necessarily
					follows that a larger number of good things is a greater good than one or a
					smaller number, if the one or the smaller number is reckoned as one of
					them;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The one, the smaller number, and the
						greater number must be of the same species. Thus, 5 pounds is a greater good
						than 2 pounds; but 5 farthings is not a greater good than 2 pounds, since
						the smaller number is not reckoned in with the greater <persName><surname full="yes">Buckley</surname></persName>.</note><lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />for it exceeds them and that which is contained is exceeded.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4" />And if that which is greatest in one class
					surpass that which is greatest in another class, the first class will surpass
					the second; and whenever one class surpasses another, the greatest of that class
					will surpass the greatest of the other. For instance, if the biggest man is
					greater than the biggest woman, men in general will be bigger than women; and if
					men in general are bigger than women, the biggest man will be bigger than the
					biggest woman; for the superiority of classes and of the greatest things
					contained in them are proportionate. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />And when
					this follows on that, but not that on this [then
					“that” is the greater good];<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">If B （life） follows on, is the consequent
						of A （health）, but A is not the consequent of B, then A is
						a greater good than B.</note> for the enjoyment of that which follows is
					contained in that of the other. Now, things follow simultaneously, or
					successively, or potentially; thus, life follows simultaneously on health, but
					not health on life; knowledge follows subsequently on learning [but not
					learning on knowledge]; and simple theft potentially on sacrilege, for
					one who commits sacrilege will also steal. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />And
					things which exceed the same thing by a greater amount [than something
					else] are greater, for they must also exceed the greater.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Eight is greater than 2 by 6, which itself is
						greater than 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7" />And things which produce a greater good are
					greater; for this we agreed was the meaning of productive of greater. And
					similarly, that which is produced by a greater cause; for if that which produces
					health is more desirable than that which produces pleasure and a greater good,
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1364a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />then health is a greater
					good than pleasure. <milestone unit="section" n="8" />And that which is more
					desirable in itself is superior to that which is not; for example, strength is a
					greater good than the wholesome, which is not desirable for its own sake, while
					strength is; and, this we agreed was the meaning of a good. <milestone unit="section" n="9" />And the end is a greater good than the means; for the
					latter is desirable for the sake of something else, the former for its own sake;
					for instance, exercise is only a means for the acquirement of a good
					constitution. <milestone unit="section" n="10" />And that which has less need of
					one or several other things in addition is a greater good, for it is more
					independent （and “having less need” means needing
					fewer or easier additions）. <milestone unit="section" n="11" />And when
					one thing does not exist or cannot be brought into existence without the aid of
					another, but that other can, then that which needs no aid is more independent,
					and accordingly is seen to be a greater good.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12" />And if one thing is a first principle, and
					another not; if one thing is a cause and another not, for the same reason; for
					without cause or first principle nothing can exist or come into existence. And
					if there are two first principles or two causes, that which results from the
					greater is greater; and conversely, when there are two first principles or two
					causes, that which is the first cause or principle of the greater is greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13" />It is clear then, from what has been said,
					that a thing may be greater in two ways; for if it is a first principle but
					another is not, it will appear to be greater, and if it is not a first principle
					[but an end], while another is; for the end is greater and not
					a first principle.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">A thing may be of greater
						importance in two ways: （a） that which is a first
						principle is superior to that which is not; （b） that which
						is not a first principle, but an end, is superior to that which is a first
						principle; for the end is superior to the means. In the illustration that
						follows: （a） the first principle （suggesting the
						plot） is said to be of more importance （worse）
						than the end or result （carrying out the plot）;
						（b） on the other hand, this end is said to be worse than
						the first principle, since the end is superior to the means. Thus the
						question of the amount of guilt can be argued both ways.</note> Thus,
					Leodamas, when accusing Callistratus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Oropus,
						a frontier-town of <placeName key="tgn,7002683" authname="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and
						<placeName key="tgn,7002681" authname="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, had been occupied by
						the Thebans （<date value="-366" authname="-366">366</date> B.C.）.
						Callistratus suggested an arrangement which was agreed to and carried out by
						Chabrias—that the town should remain in Theban possession for the
						time being. Negotiations proved unsuccessful and the Thebans refused to
						leave, whereupon Chabrias and Callistratus were brought to trial. Leodamas
						was an Athenian orator, pupil of Isocrates, and pro-Theban in his political
						views.</note> declared that the man who had given the advice<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />was more guilty than the one who carried it out; for if he had not
					suggested it, it could not have been carried out. And conversely, when accusing
					Chabrias, he declared that the man who had carried out the advice was more
					guilty than the one who had given it; for it could not have been carried out,
					had there not been some one to do so, and the reason why people devised plots
					was that others might carry them out.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14" />And that which is scarcer is a greater good
					than that which is abundant, as gold than iron, although it is less useful, but
					the possession of it is more valuable, since it is more difficult of
					acquisition. From another point of view, that which is abundant is to be
					preferred to that which is scarce, because the use of it is greater, for
					“often” exceeds “seldom,”; whence the
					saying: <quote>

						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15" />And, speaking generally, that which is more
					difficult is preferable to that which is easier of attainment, for it is
					scarcer; but from another point of view that which is easier is preferable to
					that which is more difficult; for its nature is as we wish. <milestone unit="section" n="16" />And that, the contrary or the deprivation of which is
					greater, is the greater good.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">e.g. it is worse
						to be blind than deaf; therefore sight is better than hearing
						（Schrader）.</note> And virtue is greater than non-virtue,
					and vice than non-vice; for virtues and vices are ends, the others not.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17" />And those things whose works are nobler or
					more disgraceful are themselves greater; and the works of those things, the
					vices and virtues of which are greater, will also be greater, since between
					causes and first principles compared with results there is the same relation as
					between results compared with causes and first principles. <milestone unit="section" n="18" />Things, superiority in which is more desirable or
					nobler, are to be preferred; for instance, sharpness of sight is preferable to
					keenness of smell for sight is better than smell. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1364b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />And loving one's friends more than money is nobler,
					whence it follows that love of friends is nobler than love of money. And, on the
					other hand, the better and nobler things are, the better and nobler will be
					their superiority; and similarly, those things, the desire for which is nobler
					and better, are themselves nobler and better, <milestone unit="section" n="19" />for greater longings are directed towards greater objects. For the same
					reason, the better and nobler the object, the better and nobler are the desires.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="20" />And when the sciences are nobler and more
					dignified, the nobler and more dignified are their subjects; for as is the
					science, so is the truth which is its object, and each science prescribes that
					which properly belongs to it; and, by analogy, the nobler and more dignified the
					objects of a science, the nobler and more dignified is the science itself, for
					the same reasons. <milestone unit="section" n="21" />And that which men of
					practical wisdom, either all, or more, or the best of them, would judge, or have
					judged, to be a greater good, must necessarily be such, either absolutely or in
					so far as they have judged as men of practical wisdom. The same may be said in
					regard to everything else; for the nature, quantity, and quality of things are
					such as would be defined by science and practical wisdom. But our statement only
					applies to goods; for we defined that as good which everything, if possessed of
					practical wisdom, would choose; hence it is evident that that is a greater good
					to which practical wisdom assigns the superiority. <milestone unit="section" n="22" />So also are those things which better men<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />possess, either absolutely, or in so far as they are better; for instance
					courage is better than strength. And what the better man would choose, either
					absolutely or in so far as he is better; thus, it is better to suffer wrong than
					to commit it, for that is what the juster man would choose. <milestone unit="section" n="23" />And that which is more agreeable rather than that
					which is less so; for all things pursue pleasure and desire it for its own sake;
					and it is by these conditions that the good and the end have been defined. And
					that is more agreeable which is less subject to pain and is agreeable for a
					longer time. <milestone unit="section" n="24" />And that which is nobler than
					that which is less noble; for the noble is that which is either agreeable or
					desirable in itself. <milestone unit="section" n="25" />And all things which we
					have a greater desire to be instrumental in procuring for ourselves or for our
					friends are greater goods, and those as to which our desire is least are greater
					evils. <milestone unit="section" n="26" />And things that last longer are
					preferable to those that are of shorter duration, and those that are safer to
					those that are less so; for time increases the use of the first and the wish
					that of the second; for whenever we wish, we can make greater use of things that
					are safe.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="27" /> And things in all cases follow the relations
					between coordinates and similar inflections; for instance, if
					“courageously” is nobler than and preferable to
					“temperately,” then “courage” is
					preferable to “temperance,” and it is better to be
					“courageous” than “temperate.”
					<milestone unit="section" n="28" />And that which is chosen by all is better
					than that which is not; and that which the majority choose than that which the
					minority choose; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1365a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />for, as we
					have said, the good is that which all desire, and consequently a good is
					greater, the more it is desired. The same applies to goods which are recognized
					as greater by opponents or enemies, by judges, or by those whom they select; for
					in the one case it would be, so to say, the verdict of all mankind, in the other
					that of those who are acknowledged authorities and experts. <milestone unit="section" n="29" />And sometimes a good is greater in which all
					participate, for it is a disgrace not to participate in it; sometimes when none
					or only a few participate in it, for it is scarcer. <milestone unit="section" n="30" />And things which are more praiseworthy, since they are nobler. And
					in the same way things which are more highly honored,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">“Things of which the prices are greater, price
						being a sort of worth” （Jebb）.</note> for honor
					is a sort of measure of worth; and conversely those things are greater evils,
					the punishment for which is greater. <milestone unit="section" n="31" />And those
					things which are greater than what is acknowledged, or appears, to be great, are
					greater. And the same whole when divided into parts appears greater, for there
					appears to be superiority in a greater number of things.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, “superiority over a greater number of

				<p>Combination and building up, as employed by Epicharmus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Epicharmus （c. <dateRange from="-550" to="-460" authname="-550/-460">550</dateRange>-460 B.C.） writer of comedies and Pythagorean

					reason; for combination is an exhibition of great superiority and appears to be
					the origin and cause of great things. <milestone unit="section" n="32" />And
					since that which is harder to obtain and scarcer is greater,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />it follows that special occasions, ages, places, times, and powers,
					produce great effects; for if a man does things beyond his powers, beyond his

					greater need, as in old age and illness, are greater goods. And of two things
					that which is nearer the end proposed is preferable. And that which is useful
					for the individual is preferable to that which is useful absolutely;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">καὶ

					is the possible that is useful to us, not the impossible. And those things which
					are at the end of life; for things near the end are more like ends. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1365b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="36" />And real things are preferable to those that
					have reference to public opinion, the latter being defined as those which a man
					would not choose if they were likely to remain unnoticed by others. It would
					seem then that it is better to receive than to confer a benefit; for one would
					choose the former even if it should pass unnoticed, whereas one would not choose
					to confer a benefit, if it were likely to remain unknown. <milestone unit="section" n="37" />Those things also are to be preferred, which men
					would rather possess in reality than in appearance, because they are nearer the
					truth; wherefore it is commonly said that justice is a thing of little
					importance, because people prefer to appear just than to be just; and this is
					not the case, for instance, in regard to health. <milestone unit="section" n="38" />The same may be said of things that serve several ends; for
					instance, those that assist us to live, to live well, to enjoy life, and to do
					noble actions; wherefore health and wealth seem to be the greatest goods, for
					they include all these advantages. <milestone unit="section" n="39" />And that
					which is more free from pain and accompanied by pleasure is a greater good; for
					there is more than one good, since pleasure and freedom from pain combined are
					both goods. And of two goods the greater is that which, added to one and the
					same, makes the whole greater. <milestone unit="section" n="40" />And those
					things, the presence of which does not escape notice, are preferable to those
