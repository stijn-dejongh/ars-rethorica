<TEI.2><text lang="en"><body><div1 n="1" type="book" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12" /><milestone unit="section" n="1" />Such are the
					motives of injustice; let us now state the frame of mind of those who commit it,
					and who are the sufferers from it. Men do wrong when they think that it can be
					done and that it can be done by them; when they think that their action will
					either be undiscovered, or if discovered will remain unpunished; or if it is
					punished, that the punishment will be less than the profit to themselves or to
					those for whom they care. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />As for the kind of
					things which seem possible or impossible, we will discuss them later,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book 2.19.</note> for these topics are common
					to all kinds of rhetoric. Now men who commit wrong think they are most likely to
					be able to do so with impunity, if they are eloquent, business-like, experienced
					in judicial trials, if they have many friends, and if they are wealthy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3" />They think there is the greatest chance of
					their being able to do so, if they themselves belong to the above classes; if
					not, if they have friends, servants, or accomplices who do; for thanks to these
					qualities they are able to commit wrong and to escape discovery and punishment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4" />Similarly, if they are friends of those who
					are being wronged, or of the judges; for friends are not on their guard against
					being wronged and, besides, they prefer reconciliation<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />to
					taking proceedings; and judges favor those whom they are fond of, and either let
					them off altogether or inflict a small penalty.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5" />Those are likely to remain undetected whose
					qualities are out of keeping with the charges, for instance, if a man wanting in
					physical strength were accused of assault and battery, or a poor and an ugly
					man<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Two different persons. If the second
						<foreign lang="greek">ὁ</foreign> be omitted, the reference is to
						one.</note> of adultery. Also, if the acts are done quite openly and in sight of
					all; for they are not guarded against, because no one would think them possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6" />Also, if they are so great and of such a
					nature that no one would even be likely to attempt them, for these also are not
					guarded against; for all guard against ordinary ailments and wrongs, but no one
					takes precautions against those ailments from which no one has ever yet
					suffered. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />And those who have either no enemy at
					all or many; the former hope to escape notice because they are not watched, the
					latter do escape because they would not be thought likely to attack those who
					are on their guard and because they can defend themselves by the plea that they
					would never have attempted it. <milestone unit="section" n="8" />And, those who
					have ways or places of concealment for stolen property, or abundant
					opportunities of disposing of it.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, a
						“resourceful mind.” </note> And those who, even if they
					do not remain undetected, can get the trial set aside or put off, or corrupt the
					judges. And those who, if a fine be imposed, can get payment in full set aside
					or put off for a long time, or those who, owing to poverty, have nothing to
					lose. <milestone unit="section" n="9" />And in cases where the profit is certain,
					large, or immediate, while the punishment is small, uncertain, or remote. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1372b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />And where there can be no
					punishment equal to the advantages, as seems to be the case in a tyranny.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10" />And when the unjust acts are real gains
					and the only punishment is disgrace; and when, on the contrary, the unjust acts
					tend to our credit, for instance, if one avenges father or mother, as was the
					case with Zeno,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Who Zeno was, and what the
						story, is unknown.</note> while the punishment only involves loss of money,
					exile, or something of the kind. For men do wrong from both these motives and in
					both these conditions of mind; but the persons are not the same, and their
					characters are exactly opposite.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Some do wrong
						for the sake of gain, others for the sake of praise; but the former
						sacrifice honor for self-interest, the latter self-interest for honor.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11" />And those who have often been undetected or
					have escaped punishment; and those who have often been unsuccessful; for in such
					cases, as in actual warfare, there are always men ready to return to the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12" />And all who hope for pleasure and profit
					at once, while the pain and the loss come later; such are the intemperate,
					intemperance being concerned with all things that men long for. <milestone unit="section" n="13" />And when, on the contrary, the pain or the loss is
					immediate, while the pleasure and the profit are later and more lasting<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">“More distant”
						（Jebb）.</note>; for temperate and wiser men pursue such
					aims. <milestone unit="section" n="14" />And those who may possibly be thought to
					have acted by chance or from necessity, from some natural impulse or from habit,
					in a word, to have committed an error rather than a crime. <milestone unit="section" n="15" />And those who hope to obtain indulgence; and all
					those who are in need, which is of two kinds;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />for men
					either need what is necessary, as the poor, or what is superfluous, as the
					wealthy. <milestone unit="section" n="16" />And those who are highly esteemed or
					held in great contempt; the former will not be suspected, the latter no more
					than they are already.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17" />In such a frame of mind men attempt to do
					wrong, and the objects of their wrongdoing are men and circumstances of the
					following kind.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">With a comma or colon after
						<foreign lang="greek">τὰ τοιαῦτα</foreign>; without these render:
						“those who possess such things as they . . .”</note>
					Those who possess what they themselves lack, things either necessary, or
					superfluous, or enjoyable; <milestone unit="section" n="18" />both those who are
					far off and those who are near, for in the one case the gain is speedy, in the
					other reprisals are slow, as if, for instance, Greeks were to plunder
					Carthaginians.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Who were too far off to
						retaliate.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="19" />And those who never take precautions and are
					never on their guard, but are confiding; for all these are easily taken
					unawares. And those who are indolent; for it requires a man who takes pains to
					prosecute. And those who are bashful; for they are not likely to fight about
					money. <milestone unit="section" n="20" />And those who have often been wronged
					but have not prosecuted, being, as the proverb says, “Mysian
					booty.”<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">A proverb meaning
						“an easy prey.” The Mysians were regarded as cowardly
						and unwarlike.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="21" />And those who have never, or those who have
					often, suffered wrong; for both are off their guard, the one because they have
					never yet been attacked, the others because they do not expect to be attacked
					again. <milestone unit="section" n="22" />And those who have been slandered, or
					are easy to slander; for such men neither care to go to law, for fear of the
					judges, nor, if they do, can they convince them; to this class belong those who
					are exposed to hatred or envy. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1373a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /><milestone unit="section" n="23" />And those against whom the wrongdoer can
					pretend that either their ancestors, or themselves, or their friends, have
					either committed, or intended to commit, wrong either against himself, or his
					ancestors, or those for whom he has great regard; for, as the proverb says,
					“evil-doing only needs an excuse.” <milestone unit="section" n="24" />And both enemies and friends; for it is easy to injure the latter,
					and pleasant to injure the former. And those who are friendless. And those who
					are unskilled in speech or action; for either they make no attempt to prosecute,
					or come to terms, or accomplish nothing. <milestone unit="section" n="25" />And
					those to whom it is no advantage to waste time waiting for the verdict or
					damages, such as strangers or husbandmen; for they are ready to compromise on
					easy terms and to drop proceedings. <milestone unit="section" n="26" />And those
					who have committed numerous wrongs, or such as those from which they themselves
					are suffering; for it seems almost an act of justice that a man should suffer a
					wrong such as he had been accustomed to make others suffer; if, for instance,
					one were to assault a man who was in the habit of outraging others.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">αἰκία</foreign>
						（assault） was a less serious offence than <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> （wanton outrage）.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="27" />And those who have already injured us, or
					intended, or intend, or are about to do so; for in such a case vengeance is both
					pleasant and honorable, and seems to be almost an act of justice. <milestone unit="section" n="28" />And those whom we wrong<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> i.e. supplying <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικουμένοις</foreign>, “by whose being
							wronged.” <foreign lang="greek">οὓς</foreign> has been
							suggested, i.e. supplying <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικοῦντες</foreign>,
							“wronging whom.”</note> in order to ingratiate ourselves
					with our friends, or persons whom we admire or love, or our masters, in a word,
					those by whom our life is ruled. <milestone unit="section" n="29" />And those in
					reference to whom there is a chance of obtaining merciful consideration.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">In our relations with whom, almost = from whom.
						Another interpretation is: “In reference to whom there is a chance
						. . . consideration <emph>from others</emph>, meaning the judges”
						（Welldon）.</note> And those against whom we have a
					complaint, or with whom we have had a previous difference, as Callippus acted in
					the matter of<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" /><persName><surname full="yes">Dion</surname></persName><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Callipus was a friend of
							Dion, who freed <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse" authname="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> from
							Dionysius the Younger. He afterwards accused <placeName key="perseus,Dion" authname="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName> and contrived his murder. His excuse was that
							<persName><surname full="yes">Dion</surname></persName> knew what he intended to
							do, and would be likely to strike first, if he did not anticipate
							him.</note>; for in such cases it seems almost an act of justice. <milestone unit="section" n="30" />And those who are going to be attacked by others, if
					we do not attack first, since it is no longer possible to deliberate; thus,
					Aenesidemus is said to have sent the prize in the game of cottabus to
					Gelon,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Aenesidemus, tyrant of Leontini,
						being anticipated by Gelon, tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse" authname="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, in the enslavement of a neighboring state, sent
						him the cottabus prize, as a compliment for having “played the
						game” so skilfully. The cottabus was originally a Sicilian
						game.</note> who, having reduced a town to slavery, had anticipated him by doing
					what he had intended to do himself. <milestone unit="section" n="31" />And those
					to whom, after having injured them, we shall be enabled to do many acts of
					justice, in the idea that it will he easy to repair the wrong; as Jason the
					Thessalian<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Tyrant of Pherae.</note> said
					one should sometimes commit injustice, in order to be able also to do justice
					often.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="32" />Men are ready to commit wrongs which all or
					many are in the habit of committing, for they hope to be pardoned for their
					offences. <milestone unit="section" n="33" />They steal objects that are easy to
					conceal; such are things that are quickly consumed, as eatables; things which
					can easily be changed in form or color or composition; <milestone unit="section" n="34" />things for which there are many convenient hiding-places, such as
					those that are easy to carry or stow away in a corner; <milestone unit="section" n="35" />those of which a thief already possesses a considerable number
					exactly similar or hard to distinguish. Or they commit wrongs which the victims
					are ashamed to disclose, such as outrages upon the women of their family, upon
					themselves, or upon their children. And all those wrongs in regard to which
					appeal to the law would create the appearance of litigiousness; such are wrongs
					which are unimportant or venial. These are nearly all the dispositions which
					induce men to commit wrong, the nature and motive of the wrongs, and the kind of
					persons who are the victims of wrong. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1373b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /></p>
