					assumed by us that pleasure is a certain movement of the soul, a sudden and
					perceptible settling down into its natural state, and pain the opposite.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2" />If such is the nature of pleasure, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1370a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />it is evident that that which
					produces the disposition we have just mentioned is pleasant, and that that which
					destroys it or produces the contrary settling down is painful. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Necessarily, therefore, it must be generally pleasant
					to enter into a normal state （especially when what is done in
					accordance with that state has come into its own again）<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The true nature of the “normal
						state” was lost during the period of disturbance and
						unsettlement.</note>; and the same with habits. For that which has become
					habitual becomes as it were natural; in fact, habit is something like nature,
					for the distance between “often” and
					“always” is not great, and nature belongs to the idea of
					“always,” habit to that of “often.”
					<milestone unit="section" n="4" />That which is not compulsory is also
					pleasant, for compulsion is contrary to nature. That is why what is necessary is
					painful, and it was rightly said, <quote>

						</lg>
					</quote> Application, study, and intense effort are also painful, for these
					involve necessity and compulsion, if they have not become habitual; for then
					habit makes them pleasant. Things contrary to these are pleasant; wherefore
					states of ease, idleness, carelessness, amusement, recreation,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or “rest”
						（bodily）.</note> and sleep are among pleasant things,
					because none of these is in any way compulsory. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Everything of which we have in us the desire is pleasant, for desire is a
					longing for the pleasant.</p>
				<p>Now, of desires some are irrational, others rational. I call irrational all those
					that are not the result of any<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />assumption.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">There is no consideration or
						“definite theory” （Jebb, Welldon） of
						the results that may follow. The desires arise without anything of the kind;
						they simply come.</note> Such are all those which are called natural; for
					instance, those which come into existence through the body—such as the
					desire of food, thirst, hunger, the desire of such and such food in particular;
					the desires connected with taste, sexual pleasures, in a word, with touch,
					smell, hearing, and sight. I call those desires rational which are due to our
					being convinced; for there are many things which we desire to see or acquire
					when we have heard them spoken of and are convinced that they are pleasant.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6" />And if pleasure consists in the sensation of a
					certain emotion, and imagination is a weakened sensation, then both the man who
					remembers and the man who hopes will be attended by an imagination of what he
					remembers or hopes.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The passage <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δ᾽ ἐστὶ . . . αἴσθησις</foreign> has been
						punctuated in two ways. （1） With a full stop at <foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίζει</foreign> （Roemer, Jebb）. The
						conclusion then drawn is that memory and hope are accompanied by imagination
						of what is remembered or hoped. To this it is objected that what Aristotle
						really wants to prove is that memory and hope are a cause of pleasure.
						（2） With a comma at <foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίζει</foreign> （Cope, Victorius）. The steps in the
						argument will then be: if pleasure is the sensation of a certain emotion; if
						imagination is a weakened （faded） sensation; if one who
						remembers or hopes is attended by an imagination of what he remembers or
						hopes; then, this being so, pleasure will attend one who remembers or hopes,
						since there is sensation, and pleasure is sensation and a kind of movement
						（sect. 1）. <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, the
						faculty of forming mental images （variously translated
						“imagination,” “mental impression,”
						“fantasy”） is defined by Aristotle
						（<bibl n="Aristot. de An. 3.3.11" default="NO">Aristot. De Anima
							3.3.11</bibl>） as a <emph>kind of movement</emph>, which cannot
						arise apart from sensation, and the movement produced must resemble the
						sensation which produced it. But <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>
						is more than this; it is not merely a faculty of sense, but occupies a place
						midway between sense and intellect; while imagination has need of the
						senses, the intellect has need of imagination. If <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> is referred to an earlier perception of which the
						sense image is a copy, this is memory. Imagination carries the sense images
						（ <foreign lang="greek">φαντάσματα</foreign>） to the seat
						of memory. They are then transformed into memory （of something
						past） or hope （of something future） and are
						handed on to the intellect. （See Cope here, and R. D. Hicks in his
						edition of the <title>De Anima</title>.）</note> This being so, it
					is evident that there is pleasure both for those who remember and for those who
					hope, since there is sensation. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Therefore all
					pleasant things must either be present in sensation, or past in recollection, or
					future in hope; for one senses the present, recollects the past, and hopes for
					the future. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1370b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /><milestone unit="section" n="8" />Therefore our recollections are pleasant, not only
					when they recall things which when present were agreeable, but also some things
					which were not, if their consequence subsequently proves honorable or good;
					whence the saying: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>Truly it is pleasant to remember toil after one has escaped it,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Euripides, <title>Andromeda</title>

					<milestone unit="section" n="9" />The reason of this is that even to be free from
					evil is pleasant. Things which we hope for are pleasant, when their presence
					seems likely to afford us great pleasure or advantage, without the accompaniment
					of pain. In a word, all things that afford pleasure by their presence as a rule
					also afford pleasure when we hope for or remember them. Wherefore even
					resentment is pleasant, as Homer said of anger that it is <quote>
						<lg type="dact" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>Far sweeter than dripping honey;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.109" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. Il.

					</quote> for no one feels resentment against those whom vengeance clearly cannot
					overtake, or those who are far more powerful than he is; against such, men feel
					either no resentment or at any rate less.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10" />Most of our desires are accompanied by a
					feeling of pleasure, for the recollection of a past or the hope of a future
					pleasure creates a certain pleasurable enjoyment; thus, those suffering from
					fever and tormented by thirst enjoy the remembrance of having drunk and the hope
					that they will drink again. <milestone unit="section" n="11" />The lovesick
					always take pleasure in talking, writing,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />or composing
					verses<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or “doing something that
						has to do with the beloved.”</note> about the beloved; for it
					seems to them that in all this recollection makes the object of their affection
					perceptible. Love always begins in this manner, when men are happy not only in
					the presence of the beloved, but also in his absence when they recall him to
					mind. <milestone unit="section" n="12" />This is why, even when his absence is
					painful, there is a certain amount of pleasure even in mourning and lamentation;
					for the pain is due to his absence, but there is pleasure in remembering and, as
					it were, seeing him and recalling his actions and personality. Wherefore it was
					rightly said by the poet; <quote>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13" />And revenge is pleasant; for if it is painful
					to be unsuccessful, it is pleasant to succeed. Now, those who are resentful are
					pained beyond measure when they fail to secure revenge, while the hope of it
					delights them. <milestone unit="section" n="14" />Victory is pleasant, not only
					to those who love to conquer, but to all; for there is produced an idea of
					superiority, which all with more or less eagerness desire. <milestone unit="section" n="15" />And since victory is pleasant, competitive and
					disputatious<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><emph>Controversiae</emph> or
						school rhetorical exercises, as well as arguing in the law courts; unless
						<foreign lang="greek">ἐριστικάς</foreign> means simply “in
						which there is rivalry.”</note> amusements must be so too, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1371a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />for victories are often gained
					in them; among these we may include games with knuckle-bones, ball-games,
					dicing, and draughts. It is the same with serious sports; for some become
					pleasant when one is familiar with them, while others are so from the outset,
					such as the chase and every description of outdoor sport; for rivalry implies
					victory. It follows from this that practice in the law courts and disputation
					are pleasant to those who are familiar with them and well qualified. <milestone unit="section" n="16" />Honor and good repute are among the most pleasant
					things, because every one imagines that he possesses the qualities of a worthy
					man, and still more when those whom he believes to be trustworthy say that he
					does. Such are neighbors rather than those who live at a distance; intimate
					friends and fellow-citizens rather than those who are unknown; contemporaries
					rather than those who come later; the sensible rather than the senseless; the
					many rather than the few; for such persons are more likely to be trustworthy
					than their opposites. As for those for whom men feel great contempt, such as
					children and animals, they pay no heed to their respect or esteem, or, if they
					do, it is not for the sake of their esteem, but for some other reason.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17" />A friend also is among pleasant things, for it
					is pleasant to love<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">For the meaning of
						<foreign lang="greek">φιλία, φιλεῖν</foreign> cf. Book
						2.4.</note>—for no one loves wine unless he finds pleasure in
					it—just as it is pleasant to be loved; for in this case also a man has
					an impression that he is really endowed<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />with good
					qualities, a thing desired by all who perceive it; and to be loved is to be
					cherished for one's own sake. <milestone unit="section" n="18" />And it is
					pleasant to be admired, because of the mere honor. Flattery and the flatterer
					are pleasant, the latter being a sham admirer and friend. <milestone unit="section" n="19" />It is pleasant to do the same things often; for that
					which is familiar is, as we said, pleasant. <milestone unit="section" n="20" />Change also is pleasant, since change is in the order of nature; for perpetual
					sameness creates an excess of the normal condition; whence it was said: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>Change in all things is sweet.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><bibl n="Eur. Orest. 234" default="NO" valid="yes">Eur. Orest.

					</quote> This is why what we only see at intervals, whether men or things, is
					pleasant; for there is a change from the present, and at the same time it is
					rare. <milestone unit="section" n="21" />And learning and admiring are as a rule
					pleasant; for admiring implies the desire to learn, so that what causes
					admiration is to be desired, and learning implies a return to the normal.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">True knowledge or philosophy, which is the
						result of learning, is the highest condition of the intellect, its normal or
						settled state. Consequently, a return to this is pleasure, which is defined
						（11.1） as a settling down of the soul into its natural
						state after a period of disturbance.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22" />It is pleasant to bestow and to receive
					benefits; the latter is the attainment of what we desire, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1371b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />the former the possession of more than
					sufficient means,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, “larger means
						than the person benefited.”</note> both of them things that men
					desire. Since it is pleasant to do good, it must also be pleasant for men to set
					their neighbors on their feet, and to supply their deficiencies. <milestone unit="section" n="23" />And since learning and admiring are pleasant, all
					things connected with them must also be pleasant; for instance, a work of
					imitation, such as painting, sculpture, poetry, and all that is well imitated,
					even if the object of imitation is not pleasant; for it is not this that causes
					pleasure or the reverse, but the inference that the imitation and the object
					imitated are identical, so that the result is that we learn something.
					<milestone unit="section" n="24" />The same may be said of sudden changes and
					narrow escapes from danger; for all these things excite wonder. <milestone unit="section" n="25" />And since that which is in accordance with nature is
					pleasant, and things which are akin are akin in accordance with nature, all
					things akin and like are for the most part pleasant to each other, as man to
					man; horse to horse, youth to youth. This is the origin of the proverbs:
					<quote>The old have charms for the old, the young for the
						young,</quote><quote>Like to like,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.218" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. Od. 17.218</bibl>
							<foreign lang="greek">ὡς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὡς τὸν
								ὁμοῖον</foreign>.</note></quote><quote>Beast knows
									beast,</quote><quote>Birds of a feather flock together,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Literally, “ever jackdaw to
										jackdaw.”</note></quote> and all similar sayings.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26" />And since things which are akin and like are
					always pleasant to one another, and every man in the highest degree feels this
					in regard to himself, it must needs be<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />that all men are
					more or less selfish; for it is in himself above all that such conditions<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Of likeness and kinship.</note> are to be
					found. Since, then, all men are selfish, it follows that all find pleasure in
					what is their own, such as their works and words. That is why men as a rule are
					fond of those who flatter and love them, of honor, and of children; for the last
					are their own work. It is also pleasant to supply what is wanting,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">11.22.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="27" />for then it becomes our work. And since it is
					most pleasant to command, it is also pleasant to be regarded as wise<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Both practically and speculatively or
						philosophically.</note> for practical wisdom is commanding, and philosophy
					consists In the knowledge of many things that excite wonder. Further, since men
					are generally ambitious, it follows that it is also agreeable to find fault with
					our neighbors. <milestone unit="section" n="28" />And if a man thinks he excels
					in anything, he likes to devote his time to it; as Euripides says: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>And allotting the best part of each day to that in which he happens

						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="29" />Similarly, since amusement, every kind of
					relaxation, and laughter are pleasant, ridiculous things—men, words,
					or deeds—must also be pleasant. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1372a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />The ridiculous has been discussed separately in the
					<title>Poetics</title>.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Only the
						definition appears in the existing text; “The ridiculous is an
						error, painless and non-destructive ugliness （<bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1449a" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristot. Poet.
							5</bibl>）.”</note> Let this suffice for things that are
					pleasant; those that are painful will be obvious from the contraries of these.</p>
