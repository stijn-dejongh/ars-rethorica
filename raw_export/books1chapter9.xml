					speak of virtue and vice, of the noble and the disgraceful, since they
					constitute the aim of one who praises and of one who blames; for, when speaking
					of these, we shall incidentally bring to light the means of making us appear of
					such and such a character, which, as we have said, is a second method of proof;
					for it is by the same means that we shall be able to inspire confidence in
					ourselves or others in regard to virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />But
					since it happens that men, seriously or not, often praise not only a man or a
					god but even inanimate things or any ordinary animal, we ought in the same way
					to make ourselves familiar with the propositions relating to these subjects. Let
					us, then, discuss these matters also, so far as may serve for illustration.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3" />The noble, then, is that which, being desirable
					in itself is at the same time worthy of praise, or which, being good, is
					pleasant because it is good. If this is the noble, then virtue must of necessity
					be noble, for, being good, it is worthy of praise. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Virtue, it would seem, is a faculty of providing and preserving good
					things, a faculty productive of many and great benefits, in fact, of all things
					in all cases.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, “a faculty of
						doing many and great benefits to all men in all cases”
						（Jebb）.</note>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1366b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /><milestone unit="section" n="5" />The components of virtue are justice, courage, self-control,
					magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative
					wisdom. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />The greatest virtues are necessarily
					those which are most useful to others, if virtue is the faculty of conferring
					benefits. For this reason justice and courage are the most esteemed, the latter
					being useful to others in war, the former in peace as well. Next is liberality,
					for the liberal spend freely and do not dispute the possession of wealth, which
					is the chief object of other men's desire. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Justice is a virtue which assigns to each man his due in conformity with the
					law; injustice claims what belongs to others, in opposition to the law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8" />Courage makes men perform noble acts in the
					midst of dangers according to the dictates of the law and in submission to it;
					the contrary is cowardice. <milestone unit="section" n="9" />Self-control is a
					virtue which disposes men in regard to the pleasures of the body as the law
					prescribes; the contrary is licentiousness. <milestone unit="section" n="10" />Liberality does good in many matters; the contrary is avarice. <milestone unit="section" n="11" />Magnanimity is a virtue productive of great benefits;
					the contrary is little-mindedness. <milestone unit="section" n="12" />Magnificence is a virtue which produces greatness in matters of expenditure;
					the contraries are little-mindedness<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />and meanness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13" />Practical wisdom is a virtue of reason,
					which enables men to come to a wise decision in regard to good and evil things,
					which have been mentioned as connected with happiness.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">εἰς εὐδαιμονίαν</foreign>
						with <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύεσθαι</foreign>, “come to a wise
						decision conducive to their happiness.”</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14" />Concerning virtue and vice in general and their
					separate parts, enough has been said for the moment. To discern the rest<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">i.e. the causes and results of virtue
						（Cope）; or, the noble and the disgraceful
						（Jebb）.</note> presents no difficulty; for it is evident
					that whatever produces virtue, as it tends to it, must be noble, and so also
					must be what comes from virtue; for such are its signs and works. <milestone unit="section" n="15" />But since the signs of virtue and such things as are
					the works and sufferings of a good man are noble, it necessarily follows that
					all the works and signs of courage and all courageous acts are also noble. The
					same may be said of just things and of just actions; （but not of what
					one suffers justly; for in this alone amongst the virtues that which is justly
					done is not always noble, and a just punishment is more disgraceful than an
					unjust punishment）. The same applies equally to the other virtues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16" />Those things of which the reward is honor
					are noble; also those which are done for honor rather than money. Also, those
					desirable things which a man does not do for his own sake; <milestone unit="section" n="17" />things which are absolutely good, which a man has
					done for the sake of his country, while neglecting his own interests; things
					which are naturally good; and not such as are good for the individual, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1367a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />since such things are inspired
					by selfish motives.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18" />And those things are noble which it is possible
					for a man to possess after death rather than during his lifetime, for the latter
					involve more selfishness; <milestone unit="section" n="19" />all acts done for
					the sake of others, for they are more disinterested; the successes gained, not
					for oneself but for others; and for one's benefactors, for that is justice; in a
					word, all acts of kinds, for they are disinterested. <milestone unit="section" n="20" />And the contrary of those things of which we are ashamed; for we are
					ashamed of what is disgraceful, in words, acts, or intention; as, for instance,
					when Alcaeus said: <quote>
						<lg type="lyric" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>I would fain say something, but shame holds me back,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Frag. 55
								（<title>P.L.G.</title> 3.）.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Sappho rejoined: <quote>
						<lg type="lyric" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l>Hadst thou desired what was good or noble, and had not thy tongue
								stirred up some evil to utter it, shame would not have filled thine
								eyes; but thou would'st have spoken of what is right.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Frag. 28
									（<title>P.L.G.</title> 3.）.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21" />Those things also are noble for which men
					anxiously strive, but without fear; for men are thus affected about goods which
					lead to good repute. <milestone unit="section" n="22" />Virtues and actions are
					nobler, when they proceed from those who are naturally worthier, for instance,
					from a man rather than from a woman. <milestone unit="section" n="23" />It is the
					same with those which are the cause of enjoyment to others rather than to
					ourselves; this is why justice and that which is just are noble.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" /><milestone unit="section" n="24" />To take vengeance on one's enemies
					is nobler than to come to terms with them; for to retaliate is just, and that
					which is just is noble; and further, a courageous man ought not to allow himself
					to be beaten. <milestone unit="section" n="25" />Victory and honor also are
					noble; for both are desirable even when they are fruitless, and are
					manifestations of superior virtue. And things worthy of remembrance, which are
					the more honorable the longer their memory lasts; those which follow us after
					death; those which are accompanied by honor; and those which are out of the
					common. Those which are only possessed by a single individual, because they are
					more worthy of remembrance. <milestone unit="section" n="26" />And possessions
					which bring no profit; for they are more gentlemanly. Customs that are peculiar
					to individual peoples and all the tokens of what is esteemed among them are
					noble; for instance, in <placeName key="tgn,7011065" authname="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> it
					is noble to wear one's hair long, for it is the mark of a gentleman, the
					performance of any servile task being difficult for one whose hair is long.
					<milestone unit="section" n="27" />And not carrying on any vulgar profession
					is noble, for a gentleman does not live in dependence on others.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="28" />We must also assume, for the purpose of praise
					or blame, that qualities which closely resemble the real qualities are identical
					with them; for instance, that the cautious man is cold and designing, the
					simpleton good-natured, and the emotionless gentle. <milestone unit="section" n="29" />And in each case we must adopt a term from qualities closely
					connected, always in the more favorable sense; for instance, the choleric and
					passionate man may be spoken of as frank and open, the arrogant as magnificent
					and dignified; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1367b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />those in excess
					as possessing the corresponding virtue,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Those
						whose qualities are extreme may be described as possessing the virtues of
						which these are the excess.</note> the fool-hardy as courageous, the
					recklessly extravagant as liberal. For most people will think so, and at the
					same time a fallacious argument may be drawn from the motive; for if a man risks
					his life when there is no necessity, much more will he be thought likely to do
					so when it is honorable; and if he is lavish to all comers, the more so will he
					be to his friends; for the height of virtue is to do good to all. <milestone unit="section" n="30" />We ought also to consider in whose presence we
					praise, for, as <persName><surname full="yes">Socrates</surname></persName> said, it is not difficult to praise Athenians among
					Athenians.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><bibl n="Plat. Menex. 235d" default="NO" valid="yes">Plat. Menex. 235d</bibl>.</note> We ought also to speak of what is
					esteemed among the particular audience, Scythians, Lacedaemonians, or
					philosophers,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Thus, the Scythians may be
						assumed to be brave and great hunters; the Spartans hardy, courageous, and
						brief in speech; the Athenians fond of literature—and they should
						be praised accordingly.</note> as actually existing there. And, generally
					speaking, that which is esteemed should be classed as noble, since there seems
					to be a close resemblance between the two.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">That is, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τίμιον</foreign> looks as if it were
						really <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign>, and should be spoken as if it
						were so.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="31" />Again, all such actions as are in accord with
					what is fitting are noble; if, for instance, they are worthy of a man's
					ancestors or of his own previous achievements; for to obtain additional honor is
					noble and conduces to happiness. Also, if the tendency of what is done is better
					and nobler, and goes beyond what is to be expected; for instance, if a man is
					moderate in good fortune and stout-hearted in adversity, or if, when he becomes
					greater, he is better and more forgiving. Such was the phrase of Iphicrates,
					“Look what I started from !”<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Cp. 7.32 above.</note> and of the Olympian victor: <quote>
							<lg type="eleg" org="uniform" sample="complete">

						</quote>
					<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />and of Simonides: <quote>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="32" />Since praise is founded on actions, and acting
					according to moral purpose is characteristic of the worthy man, we must endeavor
					to show that a man is acting in that manner, and it is useful that it should
					appear that he has done so on several occasions. For this reason also one must
					assume that accidents and strokes of good fortune are due to moral purpose; for
					if a number of similar examples can be adduced, they will be thought to be signs
					of virtue and moral purpose.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="33" />Now praise is language that sets forth
					greatness of virtue; hence it is necessary to show that a man's actions are
					virtuous. But encomium deals with achievements—all attendant
					circumstances, such as noble birth and education, merely conduce to persuasion;
					for it is probable that virtuous parents will have virtuous offspring and that a
					man will turn out as he has been brought up. Hence we pronounce an encomium upon
					those who have achieved something. Achievements, in fact, are signs of moral
					habit; for we should praise even a man who had not achieved anything, if we felt
					confident that he was likely to do so. <milestone unit="section" n="34" />Blessing and felicitation are identical with each other, but are not the same
					as praise and encomium, which, as virtue is contained in happiness, are
					contained in felicitation.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="35" />Praise and counsels have a common aspect; for
					what you might suggest in counseling becomes encomium by a change in the phrase.
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1368a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /><milestone unit="section" n="36" />Accordingly, when we know what we ought to do and the qualities we
					ought to possess, we ought to make a change in the phrase and turn it, employing
					this knowledge as a suggestion. For instance, the statement that “one
					ought not to pride oneself on goods which are due to fortune, but on those which
					are due to oneself alone,” when expressed in this way, has the force
					of a suggestion; but expressed thus, “he was proud, not of goods which
					were due to fortune, but of those which were due to himself alone,” it
					becomes praise. Accordingly, if you desire to praise, look what you would
					suggest; if you desire to suggest, look what you would praise. <milestone unit="section" n="37" />The form of the expression will necessarily be
					opposite, when the prohibitive has been changed into the non-prohibitive.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">In the first sentence, the statement is
						imperative, there is a prohibition; in the second, it is a simple
						affirmative, implying praise. In the one case there is forbidding, in the
						other not-forbidding, which are opposites.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="38" />We must also employ many of the means of
					amplification; for instance, if a man has done anything alone, or first, or with
					a few, or has been chiefly responsible for it; all these circumstances render an
					action noble. Similarly, topics derived from times and seasons, that is to say,
					if our expectation is surpassed. Also, if a man has often been successful in the
					same thing; for this is of importance and would appear to be due to the man
					himself, and not to be the result of chance. And if it is for his sake that
					distinctions which are an encouragement or honor have been invented and
					established; and if he was the first on whom an encomium was pronounced, as
					Hippolochus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Nothing more is known of
						him.</note> or to whom a statue was set up in the market-place, as to Harmodius
					and Aristogiton.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Who slew Hipparchus, tyrant
						of <placeName key="perseus,Athens" authname="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> And similarly
					in opposite cases. If he does not furnish you with enough material in
					himself,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />you must compare him with others, as
					Isocrates used to do, because of his inexperience<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Reading <foreign lang="greek">ἀσυνήθειαν</foreign>. He had
						no legal practice, which would have shown the irrelevancy of comparisons in
						a law court, whereas in epideictic speeches they are useful. <foreign lang="greek">συνήθειαν</foreign> gives exactly the opposite sense, and
						must refer to his having written speeches for others to deliver in the
						courts.</note> of forensic speaking. And you must compare him with
					illustrious personages, for it affords ground for amplification and is noble, if
					he can be proved better than men of worth. <milestone unit="section" n="39" />Amplification is with good reason ranked as one of the forms of praise, since
					it consists in superiority, and superiority is one of the things that are noble.
					That is why, if you cannot compare him with illustrious personages, you must
					compare him with ordinary persons, since superiority is thought to indicate
					virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="40" />Speaking generally, of the topics
					common to all rhetorical arguments, amplification is most suitable for
					epideictic speakers, whose subject is actions which are not disputed, so that
					all that remains to be done is to attribute beauty and importance to them.
					Examples are most suitable for deliberative speakers, for it is by examination
					of the past that we divine and judge the future. Enthymemes are most suitable
					for forensic speakers, because the past, by reason of its obscurity, above all
					lends itself to the investigation of causes and to demonstrative proof.
					<milestone unit="section" n="41" />Such are nearly all the materials of
					praise or blame, the things which those who praise or blame should keep in view,
					and the sources of encomia and invective; for when these are known their
					contraries are obvious, since blame is derived from the contrary things. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1368b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" /></p>
