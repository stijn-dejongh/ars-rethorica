					individually and in common, nearly all have some aim, in the attainment of which
					they choose or avoid certain things. This aim, briefly stated, is happiness and
					its component parts. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Therefore, for the sake of
					illustration, let us ascertain what happiness, generally speaking, is, and what
					its parts consist in; for all who exhort or dissuade discuss happiness and the
					things which conduce or are detrimental to it. For one should do the things
					which procure happiness or one of its parts, or increase instead of diminishing
					it, and avoid doing those things which destroy or hinder it or bring about what
					is contrary to it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3" />Let us then define happiness as well-being
					combined with virtue, or independence of life, or the life that is most
					agreeable combined with security, or abundance of possessions and slaves,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">This is the usual rendering, although it is
						hardly satisfactory. Jebb translates “a flourishing state . . . of
						body.”</note> combined with power to protect and make use of
					them<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, “bring
						about,” “effect them.”</note>; for nearly all
					men admit that one or more of these things constitutes happiness. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />If, then, such is the nature of happiness, its
					component parts must necessarily be:<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />noble birth,
					numerous friends, good friends, wealth, good children, numerous children, a good
					old age; further, bodily excellences, such as health, beauty, strength, stature,
					fitness for athletic contests, a good reputation, honor, good luck, virtue. For
					a man would be entirely independent, provided he possessed all internal and
					external goods; for there are no others. Internal goods are those of mind and
					body; external goods are noble birth, friends, wealth, honor. To these we think
					should be added certain capacities<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><emph>i.e.</emph> of mind and body; or <foreign lang="greek">δυνάμεις</foreign> may mean “positions of authority and
						influence.”</note> and good luck; for on these conditions life
					will be perfectly secure. Let us now in the same way define each of these in
					detail.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5" />Noble birth, in the case of a nation or State,
					means that its members or inhabitants are sprung from the soil<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">This was a favorite boast of the
						Athenians.</note>, or of long standing; that its first members were famous as
					leaders, and that many of their descendants have been famous for qualities that
					are highly esteemed. In the case of private individuals, noble birth is derived
					from either the father's or the mother's side, and on both sides there must be
					legitimacy; and, as in the case of a State, it means that its founders were
					distinguished for virtue, or wealth, or any other of the things that men honor,
					and that a number of famous persons, both men and women, young and old, belong
					to the family.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6" />The blessing of good children and numerous
					children needs little explanation. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1361a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />For the commonwealth it consists in a large number of good young men,
					good in bodily excellences, such as stature, beauty, strength, fitness for
					athletic contests; the moral excellences of a young man are self-control and
					courage. For the individual it consists in a number of good children of his own,
					both male and female, and such as we have described. Female bodily excellences
					are beauty and stature, their moral excellences self-control and industrious
					habits, free from servility.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">ἀνελευθερία</foreign>: literally, qualities unbecoming to
						a free man or woman, ungentlemanly, unladylike; hence, mean, servile,
						sordid.</note> The object of both the individual and of the community should
					be to secure the existence of each of these qualities in both men and women; for
					all those States in which the character of women is unsatisfactory, as in
					<placeName key="tgn,7011065" authname="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">A similar charge against the Spartan woman is made in <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1274a" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristot. Pol. 2.9.5</bibl>: “Further
						the looseness （ <foreign lang="greek">ἄνεσις</foreign>）
						of the Spartan women is injurious both to the purpose of the constitution
						and the well-being of the State . . . their life is one of absolute luxury
						and intemperance” （compare <bibl n="Eur. Andr. 595" default="NO" valid="yes">Eur. Andr. 595-596</bibl> “even if she wished it, a Spartan
						girl could not be chaste”）. The opinion of Xenophon and
						Plutarch is much more favorable.</note> may be considered only half-happy.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7" />Wealth consists in abundance of money, ownership
					of land and properties, and further of movables, cattle, and slaves, remarkable
					for number, size, and beauty, if they are all secure, liberal, and useful.
					Property that is productive is more useful, but that which has enjoyment for its
					object is more liberal. By productive I mean that which is a source of income,
					by enjoyable that which offers no advantage beyond the use of it—at
					least, none worth mentioning. Security may be defined<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />as
					possession of property in such places and on such conditions that the use of it
					is in our own hands; and ownership as the right of alienation or not<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">ἢ μή</foreign>: in the
						MS. readings these words follow <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ οἰκεῖα
							εἶναι</foreign>: “ownership or non-ownership.” The
						alteration is Spengel's.</note>, by which I mean giving the property away or
					selling it. In a word, being wealthy consists rather in use than in possession;
					for the actualization<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>: realization in action or fact.</note> and use of
					such things is wealth.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8" />A good reputation consists in being considered a
					man of worth by all, or in possessing something of such a nature that all or
					most men, or the good, or the men of practical wisdom desire it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9" />Honor is a token of a reputation for doing good;
					and those who have already done good are justly and above all honored, not but
					that he who is capable of doing good is also honored. Doing good relates either
					to personal security and all the causes of existence; or to wealth; or to any
					other good things which are not easy to acquire, either in any conditions, or at
					such a place, or at such a time; for many obtain honor for things that appear
					trifling, but this depends upon place and time. The components of honor are
					sacrifices, memorials in verse and prose, privileges, grants of land, front
					seats, public burial, State maintenance, and among the barbarians, prostration
					and giving place, and all gifts which are highly prized in each country. For a
					gift is at once a giving of a possession and a token of honor; wherefore gifts
					are desired by the ambitious and by those who are fond of money, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1361b" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />since they are an acquisition for the
					latter and an honor for the former; so that they furnish both with what they
					want.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10" />Bodily excellence is health, and of such a kind
					that when exercising the body we are free from sickness; for many are healthy in
					the way Herodicus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Of <placeName key="perseus,Selymbria" authname="perseus,Selymbria">Selymbria</placeName>, physician and teacher of
						hygienic gymnastics （c. <date value="-420" authname="-420">420</date>
						B.C.）. He is said to have made his patients walk from <placeName key="perseus,Athens" authname="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Megara" authname="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> and back, about 70 miles. He was
						satirized by Plato and by his old pupil Hippocrates as one who killed those
						for whom he prescribed （cf. 2.23.29）.</note> is said to
					have been, whom no one would consider happy in the matter of health, because
					they are obliged to abstain from all or nearly all human enjoyments.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11" />Beauty varies with each age. In a young man, it
					consists in possessing a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the
					racecourse or of bodily strength, while he himself is pleasant to look upon and
					a sheer delight. This is why the athletes in the pentathlon<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Five contests: jumping, running, discus-throwing,
						javelin-throwing, wrestling.</note> are most beautiful, because they are
					naturally adapted for bodily exertion and for swiftness of foot. In a man who
					has reached his prime, beauty consists in being naturally adapted for the toils
					of war, in being pleasant to look upon and at the same time awe-inspiring. In an
					old man, beauty consists in being naturally adapted to contend with unavoidable
					labors and in not causing annoyance<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or simply,
						“freedom from pain” （5.15）.</note> to
					others, thanks to the absence of the disagreeable accompaniments of old age.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12" />Strength consists in the power of moving
					another as one wills, for which purpose it is necessary to pull or push, to
					lift, to squeeze or crush, so that the strong man is strong by virtue of being
					able to do all or some of these things.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13" />Excellence of stature consists in being
					superior to most men in height, depth, and breadth,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20" />but
					in such proportion as not to render the movements of the body slower as the
					result of excess.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14" />Bodily excellence in athletics consists in
					size, strength, and swiftness of foot; for to be swift is to be strong. For one
					who is able to throw his legs about in a certain way, to move them rapidly and
					with long strides, makes a good runner; one who can hug and grapple, a good
					wrestler; one who can thrust away by a blow of the fist, a good boxer; one who
					excels in boxing and wrestling is fit for the pancratium,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">A combination of wrestling and boxing.</note> he who excels
					in all for the pentathlon.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15" />A happy old age is one that comes slowly with
					freedom from pain; for neither one who rapidly grows old nor one who grows old
					insensibly but with pain enjoys a happy old age. This also depends upon bodily
					excellences and good fortune; for unless a man is free from illness and is
					strong, he will never be free from suffering, nor will he live long and
					painlessly without good fortune. Apart from health and strength, however, there
					is a power of vitality in certain cases; for many live long who are not endowed
					with bodily excellences. But a minute examination of such questions is needless
					for the present purpose.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16" />The meaning of numerous and worthy friends is
					easy to understand from the definition of a friend. A friend is one who exerts
					himself to do for the sake of another what he thinks is advantageous to him. A
					man to whom many persons are so disposed, has many friends; if they are
					virtuous, he has worthy friends.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17" />Good fortune consists in the acquisition or
					possession <pb ed="Bekker" n="1362a" /><lb ed="Bekker" n="1" />of either all, or
					the most, or the most important of those goods of which fortune is the cause.
					Now fortune is the cause of some things with which the arts also are concerned,
					and also of many which have nothing to do with art, for instance, such as are
					due to nature （though it is possible that the results of fortune may be
					contrary to nature）; for art is a cause of health, but nature of beauty
					and stature.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The results of art and the
						results due to nature are often assisted （or hindered） by
						the interference of the irregular operations of fortune or chance. Health
						may be the result of fortune, as well as art （a sick man may be
						cured by a drug taken by chance, one not prescribed by the
						physician）; beauty and strength, of fortune as well as nature. It
						is parenthetically remarked that fortune may also produce unnatural
						monstrosities. The removal of the brackets and the substitution of a comma
						for the colon after <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> have been
						suggested. The meaning would then be: “for instance, such as are
						due to nature, but possibly may be also contrary to
						nature.”</note> Speaking generally, the goods which come from fortune
					are such as excite envy. Fortune is also a cause of those goods which are beyond
					calculation; for instance, a man's brothers are all ugly, while he is handsome;
					they did not see the treasure, while he found it; the arrow hit one who stood by
					and not the man aimed at; or, one who frequented a certain place was the only
					one who did not go there on a certain occasion, while those who went there then
					for the first time met their death. All such instances appear to be examples of
					good fortune.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18" />The definition of virtue, with which the topic
					of praise is most closely connected, must be left until we come to treat of the
					latter.</p>
