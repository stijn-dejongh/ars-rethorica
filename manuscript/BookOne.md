# Aristotle's Rhetoric: Book One

# Chapter One

Rhetoric is a counterpart[^1] of Dialectic; for both have to do with matters that are in a manner within the cognizance of all men and not
confined[^2] to any special science. Hence all men in a manner have a share of both; for all, up to a certain point, endeavor to criticize or
uphold an argument, to defend themselves or to accuse.

Now, the majority of people do this either at random or with a familiarity arising from habit. But since both these ways are possible, it is
clear that matters can be reduced to a system, for it is possible to examine the reason why some attain their end by familiarity and others by
chance; and such an examination all would at once admit to be the function of an art.[^3]

[^1]: **Freese:** Not an exact copy, but making a kind of pair with it, and corresponding to it as the antistrophe to the strophe in a choral ode.

[^2]: **Freese:** Or *“and they ( Rhetoric and Dialectic）are not confined.”* 

[^3]: **Freese:** The special characteristic of an art is the discovery of a system or method, as distinguished from mere knack（`ἐμπειρία`).
