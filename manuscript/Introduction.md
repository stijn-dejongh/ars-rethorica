## The perseus project

The Perseus Project - or Perseus Hopper - is a long running online digital library, which is curated by the classical studies department of Tufts University.
As an open source project, it has known many contributors since it's inception in 1987. The project is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who 
is known as the mythical slayer of monsters, and the founder of Mycenae. 

Tufts University aims to provide a comprehensive catalogue of texts from the ancient world, so modern audiences can access them freely.

## Translators

Aristotle's Rhetoric is an ancient Greek text, discussing the fine art of persuasion and debate. 
As the ancient Greeks were the founders of the democracy, public debates were an important part of their culture. 
Athenian citizens participated in what we would call "direct democracy" in our modern age. Meaning that any (male, adult) citizen could 
participate in the political debate, by speaking to the assembly of citizens. 

As such, the oratory arts were highly valued, and the works of Aristotle were highly influential in the ancient world.
The original work was written in ancient greek, and translated into Latin by Roman philosophers.

As such the work has been translated multiple times, both from the original Greek and it's contemporary Latin translations.
This derivative work is based on the translation by J.H. Freese, in 1926, which is in the public domain.
Freese's translation was uploaded to the Perseus Hopper, and contains notes collected from other translations.  
Most notably, the translation notes by E. M. Cope (1877), and W.D. Ross (1959).

You can find the full translation by J.H. Freese on the Perseus Hopper, at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060).
