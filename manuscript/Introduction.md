# Introduction

{blurb, class: info}
This book is a derivative work, based on the translation of Aristotle's Rhetoric by J.H. Freese, which is in the public domain.
The publisher takes no credit for the original work, and has no intention to claim ownership of this intellectual property.
{/blurb}

The Rhetoric consists of three books. **Book I (one)** offers a general overview, presenting the purposes of rhetoric and a working definition; it 
also offers a detailed discussion of the major contexts and types of rhetoric. **Book II (two)** discusses in detail the three means of persuasion 
that an orator must rely on: those grounded in credibility (`ethos`), in the emotions and psychology of the audience (`pathos`), and in patterns 
of reasoning (`logos`). **Book III (three)** introduces the elements of style (word choice, metaphor, and sentence structure) and arrangement 
(organization) . Some attention is paid to delivery, but generally the reader is referred to Aristotle's Poetics for more information in that area.

## Translators

Aristotle's Rhetoric is an ancient Greek text, discussing the fine art of persuasion and debate.
As the ancient Greeks were the founders of the democracy, public debates were an important part of their culture.
Athenian citizens participated in what we would call "direct democracy" in our modern age. Meaning that any (male, adult) citizen could
participate in the political debate, by speaking to the assembly of citizens.

As such, the oratory arts were highly valued, and the works of Aristotle were highly influential in the ancient world.
The original work was written in ancient greek, and translated into Latin by Roman philosophers.

As such the work has been translated multiple times, both from the original Greek and it's contemporary Latin translations.
This derivative work is based on the translation by J.H. Freese, in 1926, which is in the public domain.
Freese's translation was uploaded to the Perseus Hopper, and contains notes collected from other translations.  
Most notably, the translation notes by E. M. Cope (1877), and W.D. Ross (1959).

You can find the full translation by J.H. Freese on the Perseus Hopper,

## About this book

This book was edited for the modern reader, to make the content accessible on modern devices.
It has been transpiled into the markua format, for publication of the book on the [leanpub platform](https://leanpub.com).

My reason for editing this book is because I remembered it as a very insightful text, that I read during my high school studies.
I wanted to revisit the content, as the concepts of rhetoric are highly applicable to modern day communication and persuasion.
As I was unable to find a modern digital version of the text, I decoded to transpile the text myself, and make it available to the public.

I hope you enjoy the read, and that you find the content as insightful as I did.
