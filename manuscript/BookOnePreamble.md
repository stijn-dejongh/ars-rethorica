# Preamble

## Editor's Introduction

In this book, Aristotle means to convince the reader on the usefulness of the art of persuasion. He then proceeds to explain the different
varieties of rhetoric, and the different types of arguments that can be made. As one of his main points, he explains that a skilled orator must
be well versed in the subject matter, must be eloquent, and must know his audience.

Aristotle goes into great detail about the moralistic character of the times in which he lives. In typical philosophical manner, he discusses
what people desire, what they fear, and what he deems to be the most important and valuable things in life. This makes the text somewhat harder
to read, as these reflections are interwoven with the main arguments amd his explanations of the nature of rhetoric.

We must remember that the original interpreter was a scholar of ancient Greek, and that his aim was to provide a translation that is as close to the
original style as possible. This makes the text somewhat harder to read, as the original style is quite different from modern English.
For your reading convenience, I have added "editor's notes" in the text, to clarify some of the more obscure references or phrasings.
These notes are placed in a separate block, and are denoted with an icon that looks like this:

{blurb, icon: pencil}

**editor's note:** When you read the term "end", it usually refers to "goal" or "purpose". Similar to its use in the adage *"The end justifies
the means"*, which happens to appear in this book.

{/blurb}

Where applicable, I have added a title to the chapters, to make it easier to navigate the book.
These titles are not part of the original text, as the ancients did not use titles in their writings, but used incremental numbers to keep
different parts of their writing apart.

## Glossary

Aristotle assumes the reader is familiar with terms that were common in his time. To help the modern reader, I have included a short Glossary of
the more obscure terms. At times, the original interpretation of J.H. Freese contains footnotes with additional clarification.
Those footnotes are included in the text, and are marked with a superscript number.

To make the text more understandable, this Glossary is placed at the start of the book, rather than at the end.
It is my hope that this will make the text more accessible to the reader.

**I advise you to read through these definitions before you start reading the book.**
Unless you are already familiar with the classical world, and their manner of speaking, you will find it difficult to understand the text without knowing these terms.
Aristotle sometimes explains the terms he uses, but when he does, it is done in a very concise manner and usually only after he has used the
term in multiple instances. He followed his own advice, as he explains in the book: *"The audience does not need to be explained that which they
are already familiar with."*

**Orator**
: (syn. speaker, rhetorician, public speaker)
: Someone who speaks publicly, either to a crowd, a general assembly, or in a court of law. The term "orator" is mostly used for those skilled in
    the art of persuasion, but in essence, it refers to anyone who speaks on formal occasions.

**Sophist**
: (syn. tutor, teacher, mentor, moralist)
: A paid theacher of philisophy, rethoric, and science in the ancient Hellenistic world. Sophists are assosiated with teaching other how to argue
    live a virtuous life, and how to be a good citizen. They were often criticized for their relativistic views on truth and morality, and for
    *"having their heads in the clouds"*.

**Dialectic**
: (syn. debate, argumentation, logical reasoning)
: The art of investigating or discussing the truth of opinions. It is a method of argument, using logical reasoning and questioning, that has
    been the foundation of future scientific and legal methods.

**Syllogism**
: a form of reasoning aimed at drawing a conclusion from two propositions that share a common subject. The conclusion is valid if both of the
    propositions are accurate. This is a rudimentary form of logical reasoning, stating `A & B -> C` where `A` and `B` are premises, and `C` is the
    conclusion. Modern logical theory teaches us to interpret this as: *"either `C` is true, or `A & B` is false"*, which is slightly different to
    the classical interpretation of the form.
: example 1: *all men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.*
: example 2: *all dogs are animals. All animals have four legs. Therefore, all dogs have four legs.* (in this example, the second premise is
    incorrect, as there are animals with less than four legs)

**Enthymeme**
: a form of syllogism, where one of the premises is not stated, but is implied. This is a form of argumentation that is often used in rhetoric,
    as the speaker can rely on the audience to fill in the missing premise. This makes the argument more persuasive, provided the audience has
    sufficient knowledge to fill in the gaps.

**Dicast**
: (syn. judge, juror, magistrate, official)
: A member of a jury in ancient Athens. The dicasts were selected by lot, and were paid for their service. The term is used to indicate someone
    who holds a formal position, and is asked to render judgement on a (legal) matter. The modern term "judge" is used in the text to indicate
    someone who forms an opinion on a matter, without the connotation of them being in a formal position of power.
