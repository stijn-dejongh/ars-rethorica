# Chapter 10: Litigation: accusation and defense

We have next to speak of the number and quality of the propositions of which those syllogisms are constructed which have for their object accusation
and defence. Three things have to be considered; first, the nature and the number of the motives which lead men to act unjustly; secondly, what is
the state of mind of those who so act; thirdly, the character and dispositions of those who are exposed to injustice. We will discuss these
questions in order, after we have first defined acting unjustly.

Let injustice, then, be defined as voluntarily causing injury contrary to the law. Now, the law is particular or general. By particular, I mean the written law in accordance with which a state is administered; by
general, the unwritten regulations which appear to be universally recognized. Men act voluntarily when they know what they do, and do not act under
compulsion. What is done voluntarily is not always done with premeditation; but what is done with premeditation is always known to the agent, for no
one is ignorant of what he does with a purpose. [^^9_1] The motives which lead men to do injury and commit wrong actions are depravity and
incontinence. For if men have one or more vices, it is in that which makes him vicious that he shows himself unjust; for example, the illiberal in
regard to money, the licentious in regard to bodily pleasures, the effeminate in regard to what makes for ease, [^^9_2] the coward in regard to
dangers, for fright makes him desert his comrades in peril; the ambitious in his desire for honor, the irascible owing to anger, one who is eager
to conquer in his desire for victory, the rancorous in his desire for vengeance; the foolish man from having mistaken ideas of right and wrong, the
shameless from his contempt for the opinion of others. Similarly, each of the rest of mankind is unjust in regard to his special weakness.

This will be perfectly clear, partly from what has already been said about the virtues, and partly from what will be said about the emotions. It
remains to state the motives and character of those who do wrong and of those who suffer from it. First, then, let us decide what those who set
about doing wrong long for or avoid; for it is evident that the accuser must examine the number and nature of the motives which are to be found in
his opponent; the defendant, which of them are not to be found in him. Now, all human actions are either the result of man's efforts or not. Of the
latter some are due to chance, others to necessity. Of those due to necessity, some are to be attributed to compulsion, others to nature, so that
the things which men do not do of themselves are all the result of chance, nature, or compulsion. As for those which they do of themselves and of
which they are the cause, some are the result of habit, others of longing, and of the latter some are due to rational, others to irrational longing.
Now wish is a [rational] longing for good, for no one wishes for anything unless he thinks it is good; irrational longings are anger and desire.
Thus all the actions of men must necessarily be referred to seven causes: **chance**, **nature**, **compulsion**, **habit**, **reason**, **anger**, 
and **desire**.

**editor's note:** Interestingly, the seven causes mentioned here are highly recognizable in the modern criminological concepts of *"motive"* and 
*"intent"*. Even more interesting is the fact that Aristotle already recognized that the motives for committing a crime can be either rational 
or emotional, and hints that the distinction between the two is important in determining the severity of the crime.

These ideas are expanded upon in the next chapters: [#t](#motive), and [#t](#intent).

But it is superfluous to establish further distinctions of men's acts based upon age, moral habits, or anything else. For if the young happen to
be [^^9_3] irascible, or passionately desire anything, it is not because of their youth that they act accordingly, but because of anger and desire.
Nor is it because of wealth or poverty; but the poor happen to desire wealth because of their lack of it, and the rich desire unnecessary pleasures
because they are able to procure them. Yet in their case too it will not be wealth or poverty, but desire, that will be the mainspring of their
action. Similarly, the just and the unjust, and all the others who are said to act in accordance with their moral habits, will act from the same
causes, either from reason or emotion, but some from good characters and emotions, and others from the opposite. Not but that it does happen that
such and such moral habits are followed by such and such consequences; for it may be that from the outset the fact of being temperate produces in
the temperate man good opinions and desires in the matter of pleasant things, in the intemperate man the contrary. Therefore we must leave these
distinctions on one side, but we must examine what are the usual consequences of certain conditions. For, if a man is fair or dark, tall or short,
there is no rule that any such consequences should follow, but if he is young or old, just or unjust, it does make a difference. In a word, it will
be necessary to take account of all the circumstances that make men's characters different; for instance, if a man fancies himself rich or poor,
fortunate or unfortunate, it will make a difference. We will, however, discuss this later [^^9_4] ; let us now speak of what remains to be said
here.

Things which are the result of chance are all those of which the cause is indefinite, those which happen without any end in view, and that neither
always, nor generally, nor regularly. The definition of chance will make this clear. Things which are the result of nature are all those of which
the cause is in themselves and regular; for they turn out always, or generally, in the same way. As for those which happen contrary to nature there
is no need to investigate minutely whether their occurrence is due to a certain force of nature or some other cause (it would seem, however, that
such cases also are due to chance). Those things are the result of compulsion which are done by the agents themselves in opposition to their desire
or calculation. Things are the result of habit, when they are done because they have often been done. Things are the result of calculation which are
done because, of the goods already mentioned, they appear to be expedient either as an end or means to an end, provided they are done by reason of
their being expedient; for even the intemperate do certain things that are expedient, for the sake, not of expediency, but of pleasure. Passion and
anger are the causes of acts of revenge. But there is a difference between revenge and punishment; the latter is inflicted in the interest of the
sufferer, the former in the interest of him who inflicts it, that he may obtain satisfaction. We will define anger when we come to speak of the
emotions. [^^9_5] Desire is the cause of things being done that are apparently pleasant. The things which are familiar and to which we have become
accustomed are among pleasant things; for men do with pleasure many things which are not naturally pleasant, when they have become accustomed to
them.

In short, all things that men do of themselves either are, or seem, good or pleasant; and since men do voluntarily what they do of themselves, and involuntarily what they do not, it follows that all that men do voluntarily
will be either that which is or seems good, or that which is or seems pleasant. For I reckon among good things the removal of that which is evil or
seems evil, or the exchange of a greater evil for a less, because these two things are in a way desirable; in like manner, I reckon among pleasant
things the removal of that which is or appears painful, and the exchange of a greater pain for a less. We must therefore make ourselves acquainted
with the number and quality of expedient and pleasant things. We have already spoken of the expedient when discussing deliberative
rhetoric [^^9_6] ; let us now speak of the pleasant. And we must regard our definitions as sufficient in each case, provided they are neither
obscure nor too precise.

[^^9_1]: `προαίρεσις` (premeditation, deliberate or moral choice) is always voluntary, but all voluntary action is not premeditated; we sometimes act
on the spur of the moment. Choice is a voluntary act, the result of deliberate counsel, including the use of reason and knowledge. In Aristot. Nic.
Eth. 11 Aristotle defines `προαίρεσις` as “a deliberate appetition of (longing for, `ὄρεξις` ) things in our power,” as to which we should necessarily
be well-informed.

[^^9_2]: Or, *“in the matter of ease”*, taking `τὰ ῥάθυμα` as = `ῥαθυμία` .

[^^9_3]: In the cases of the young, the poor, and the rich, their youth etc. are only “accidents,” accidental not real causes. Aristotle defines `τὸ συμβεβηκός` ( Aristot. Met. 4.30 ) as “that which is inherent in
something, and may be predicated of it as true, but neither necessarily, nor in most cases; for instance, if a man, when digging a hole for a plant,
finds a treasure.” The color of a man's eyes is an “inseparable” accident, the fact that a man is a lawyer is a “separable” accident.
