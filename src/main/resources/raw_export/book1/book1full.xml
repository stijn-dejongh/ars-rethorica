                    majority of people do this either at random or with a
                    familiarity arising from habit. But since both these ways are possible, it is
                    clear that matters can be reduced to a system, for it is possible to examine the
                    reason why some attain their end by familiarity and others by chance; and such
                    an examination all would at once admit to be the function of an art.

                    have provided us with only a small portion of this art, for proofs are the only
                    things in it that come within the province of art; everything else is merely an
                    accessory. And yet they say nothing about enthymemes which are the body of
                    proof, but chiefly devote their attention to matters outside the subject;

                    result would be that, if all trials were now carried on as they are in some

                    there would be nothing left for the rhetorician to say.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For all men

                    the principle and forbid speaking outside the subject, as in the court of
                    Areopagus, and in this they are right. For it is wrong to warp the dicast's
                    feelings, to arouse him to anger, jealousy or compassion, which would be like
                    making the rule crooked which one intended to use.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Further, it is
                    evident that the only business of the litigant is to
                    prove that the fact in question is or is not so, that it has happened or not;
                    whether it is important or unimportant, just or unjust, in all cases in which
                    the legislator has not laid down a ruling, is a matter for the dicast himself to
                    decide; it is not the business of the litigants to instruct him.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>First of all, therefore, it is proper that laws,
                    properly enacted, should themselves define the issue of all cases as far as
                    possible, and leave as little as possible to the discretion of the judges; in
                    the first place, because it is easier to find one or a few men of good sense,
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1354b"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>capable of framing laws
                    and pronouncing judgements, than a large number; secondly, legislation is the
                    result of long consideration, whereas judgements are delivered on the spur of
                    the moment, so that it is difficult for the judges properly to decide questions
                    of justice or expediency. But what is most important of all is that the
                    judgement of the legislator does not apply to a particular case, but is
                    universal and applies to the future, whereas the member of the public assembly
                    and the dicast have to decide present and definite issues, and in their case
                    love, hate, or personal interest is often involved, so that they are no longer
                    capable of discerning the truth adequately, their judgement being obscured by
                    their own pleasure or pain.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>All other cases, as we have just said, should be
                    left to the authority of the judge as seldom as possible, except where it is a
                    question of a thing having happened or not, of its going to happen or not, of
                    being or not being so; this must be left to the discretion of the judges, for it
                    is impossible for the legislator to foresee such questions.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>If this
                    is so, it is obvious that all those who
                    definitely lay down, for instance, what should be the contents of the exordium
                    or the narrative, or of the other parts of the discourse, are bringing under the
                    rules of art what is outside the subject; for the only thing to which their
                    attention is devoted<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>is how to put the judge into a
                    certain frame of mind. They give no account of the artificial proofs,
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Systematic logical proofs （enthymeme,
                        for example）, including testimony as to character and appeals to
                        the emotions （2.3）, which the rhetorician has to invent
                        （ <foreign lang="greek">εὑρεῖν</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">inventio</foreign>） for use in
                        particular cases. They are
                        contrasted with “inartificial” proofs, which have
                        nothing to do with the rules of the art, but are already in existence, and
                        only need to be made use of. The former are dealt with in chs. 4-14, the
                        latter in ch. 15 of this book.

                    which make a man a master of
                    rhetorical argument.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Hence, although the method of deliberative and
                    forensic Rhetoric is the same, and although the pursuit of the former is nobler
                    and more worthy of a statesman than that of the latter, which is limited to
                    transactions between private citizens, they say nothing about the former, but
                    without exception endeavor to bring forensic speaking under the rules of art.
                    The reason of this is that in public speaking it is less worth while to talk of
                    what is outside the subject, and that deliberative oratory lends itself to
                    trickery less than forensic, because it is of more general interest.

                    For
                    in the assembly the judges decide upon their own affairs, so that the only thing
                    necessary is to prove the truth of the statement of one who recommends a
                    measure, but in the law courts this is not sufficient; there it is useful to win
                    over the hearers, for the decision concerns other interests than those of the
                    judges, who, having only themselves to consider and listening merely for their
                    own pleasure, surrender to the pleaders but do not give a real decision.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The case as a rule being a matter of personal
                        indifference, the judges are likely to be led away by the arguments which
                        seem most plausible.

                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>That is why, as I have said
                    before, in many places the law prohibits speaking outside the subject in the law
                    courts, whereas in the assembly the judges themselves take adequate precautions
                    against this.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>It is obvious, therefore, that a system
                    arranged according to the rules of art is only concerned with proofs; that proof
                    is a sort of demonstration,

                        resembles.
                    </note>
                    since we are most strongly convinced when we suppose anything to have been
                    demonstrated; that rhetorical demonstration is an enthymeme, which, generally
                    speaking, is the strongest of rhetorical proofs and lastly, that the enthymeme
                    is a kind of syllogism. Now, as it is the function of Dialectic as a whole, or
                    of one of its parts,
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Dialectic here apparently
                        includes logic generally, the “part” being either the

                    </note>
                    to consider
                    every kind of syllogism in a similar manner, it is clear that he who is most
                    capable of examining the matter and forms of a syllogism will be in the highest
                    degree a master of rhetorical argument, if to this he adds a knowledge of the
                    subjects with which enthymemes deal and the differences between them and logical
                    syllogisms. For, in fact, the true and that which resembles it come under the
                    purview of the same faculty, and at the same time men have a sufficient natural
                    capacity for the truth and indeed in most cases attain to it; wherefore one who
                    divines well in regard to the truth will also be able to divine well in regard
                    to probabilities.

                    have
                    rather inclined to the forensic branch of oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Nevertheless,
                    Rhetoric is useful, because the true and the just are
                    naturally superior to their opposites, so that, if decisions are improperly
                    made, they must owe their defeat to their own advocates; which is reprehensible.
                    Further, in dealing with certain persons, even if we possessed the most accurate
                    scientific knowledge, we should not find it easy to persuade them by the
                    employment of such knowledge. For scientific discourse is concerned with
                    instruction,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Almost equivalent to
                        demonstration or strictly logical proof.
                    </note> but in the case of such
                    persons instruction is impossible; our proofs and arguments must rest on
                    generally accepted principles, as we said in the <title>Topics</title>,
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">1.2. The <title>Topics</title> is a treatise
                        in

                    </note>
                    when speaking of converse with the multitude. Further, the orator should be able
                    to prove opposites, as in logical arguments; not that we should do both
                    （for one ought not to persuade people to do what is wrong）,
                    but that the real state of the case may not escape us, and that we ourselves may
                    be able to counteract false arguments, if another makes an unfair use of them.
                    Rhetoric and Dialectic alone of all the arts prove opposites; for both are
                    equally concerned with them. However, it is not the same with the subject
                    matter, but, generally speaking, that which is true and better is naturally
                    always easier to prove and more likely to persuade. Besides, it would be absurd
                    if it were considered disgraceful not to be able to defend oneself with the help
                    of the body,
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1355b"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but not
                    disgraceful as far as speech is concerned, whose use is more characteristic of
                    man than that of the body.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>If it is argued
                    that one who makes an unfair use of such faculty of speech may do a great deal
                    of harm, this objection applies equally to all good things except virtue, and
                    above all to those things which are most useful, such as strength, health,
                    wealth, generalship; for as these, rightly used, may be of the greatest benefit,
                    so, wrongly used, they may do an equal amount of harm.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>It is thus evident that Rhetoric does not deal
                    with any one definite class of subjects, but, like Dialectic, [is of
                    general application]; also, that it is useful; and further, that its
                    function is not so much to persuade, as to find out in each case the existing
                    means of persuasion.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The early sophistical
                        definition was “the art of persuasion.”
                    </note> The same
                    holds good in respect to all the other arts. For instance, it is not the
                    function of medicine to restore a patient to health, but only to promote this
                    end as far as possible; for even those whose recovery is impossible may be
                    properly treated. It is further evident that it belongs to Rhetoric to discover
                    the real and apparent means of persuasion, just as it belongs to Dialectic to
                    discover the real and apparent syllogism. For what makes the sophist is not the
                    faculty but the moral purpose. But there is a difference: in Rhetoric, one who
                    acts in accordance with sound argument, and one who acts in accordance with
                    moral purpose,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>are both called rhetoricians; but in
                    Dialectic it is the moral purpose that makes the sophist, the dialectician being
                    one whose arguments rest, not on moral purpose but on the faculty.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The essence of sophistry consists in the
                        moral
                        purpose, the deliberate use of fallacious arguments. In Dialectic, the
                        dialectician has the power or faculty of making use of them when he pleases;
                        when he does so deliberately, he is called a sophist. In Rhetoric, this
                        distinction does not exist; he who uses sound arguments as well as he who
                        uses false ones are both known as rhetoricians.

                <p>Let us now endeavor to treat of the method itself, to see how and by what means
                    we shall be able to attain our objects. And so let us as it were start again,
                    and having defined Rhetoric anew, pass on to the remainder of the subject.

                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rhetoric then
                    may be defined as the faculty of discovering the possible means of persuasion in
                    reference to any subject whatever. This is the function of no other of the arts,
                    each of which is able to instruct and persuade in its own special subject; thus,
                    medicine deals with health and sickness, geometry with the properties of
                    magnitudes, arithmetic with number, and similarly with all the other arts and
                    sciences. But Rhetoric, so to say, appears to be able to discover the means of
                    persuasion in reference to any given subject. That is why we say that as an art
                    its rules are not applied to any particular definite class of things.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As for proofs, some are artificial, others
                    inartificial. By the latter I understand all those which have not been furnished
                    by ourselves but were already in existence, such as witnesses, tortures,
                    contracts, and the like; by the former, all that can be constructed by system
                    and by our own efforts. Thus we have only to make use of the latter, whereas we
                    must invent the former.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now the proofs furnished by the speech are of
                    three kinds. The first depends upon the moral character of the speaker, the
                    second upon putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind, the third upon the
                    speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The orator persuades by moral character when his
                    speech is delivered in such a manner as to render him worthy of confidence; for
                    we feel confidence in a greater degree and more readily in persons of worth in
                    regard to everything in general, but where there is no certainty and there is
                    room for doubt, our confidence is absolute. But this confidence must be due to
                    the speech itself, not to any preconceived idea of the speaker's character; for
                    it is not the case, as some writers of rhetorical treatises lay down in their
                    “Art,” that the worth of the orator in no way contributes to
                    his powers of persuasion; on the contrary, moral character, so to say,
                    constitutes the most effective means of proof.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The orator persuades
                    by means of his hearers, when they are roused to emotion
                    by his speech; for the judgements we deliver are not the same when we are
                    influenced by joy or sorrow, love or hate; and it is to this alone that, as we
                    have said, the present-day writers of treatises endeavor to devote their
                    attention. （We will discuss these matters in detail when we come to
                    speak of the emotions.）<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Lastly,
                    persuasion is produced by the speech itself, when we establish the true<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or
                    apparently true from the means of persuasion
                    applicable to each individual subject.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now, since proofs are effected by these means,
                    it is evident that, to be able to grasp them, a man must be capable of logical
                    reasoning, of studying characters and the virtues, and thirdly the
                    emotions—the nature and character of each, its origin, and the manner
                    in which it is produced. Thus it appears that Rhetoric is as it were an offshoot
                    of Dialectic and of the science of Ethics, which may be reasonably called
                    Politics.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Rhetoric, as dealing with human
                        actions, characters, virtues, and emotions, is closely connected with
                        Politics, which includes Ethics. The two latter treat of the same subject
                        from a different point of view. Both deal with happiness and virtue, but the
                        object of Politics is, by comparison of the different forms of States to
                        find the one in which man will be most virtuous. Lastly, Rhetoric, as an
                        important factor in the training and education of the individual citizen and
                        of the members of the State as a whole, may be described as an offshoot of
                        Politics, with which the sophistical rhetoricians

                    claim to possess it, partly from ignorance, partly from boastfulness, and partly
                    from other human weaknesses, do the same. For, as we said at the outset,
                    Rhetoric is a sort of division or likeness of Dialectic, since neither of them
                    is a science that deals with the nature of any definite subject, but they are
                    merely faculties of furnishing arguments. We have now said nearly enough about
                    the faculties of these arts and their mutual relations.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But for purposes of demonstration, real or
                    apparent, just as Dialectic possesses two modes of argument,

                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>induction and the syllogism, real or
                    apparent, the same is the case in Rhetoric; for the example is induction, and
                    the enthymeme a syllogism, and the apparent enthymeme an apparent syllogism.
                    Accordingly I call an enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, and an example
                    rhetorical induction. Now all orators produce belief by employing as proofs
                    either examples or enthymemes and nothing else; so that if, generally speaking,
                    it is necessary to prove any fact whatever either by syllogism or by

                    universally or in most cases, such a conclusion in Dialectic is called a

                    distinguished by their fondness for one or the other. Now arguments that depend

                    fancies—but it takes its material from subjects which demand reasoned

                    particular statement is true, it can be refuted, because it cannot be reduced to
                    syllogistic form. But if one were to say that it is a sign that a man is ill,
                    because he has a fever, or that a woman has had a child because she has milk,
                    this is a necessary sign. This alone among signs is a

                    the argument irrefutable. Other signs are related as the universal to the

                    hand are derived from propositions which are peculiar to each species or genus
                    of things; there are, for example, propositions about Physics which can furnish

                    are propositions concerned with Ethics which will be useless for furnishing

                    either a mere spectator or a judge, and a judge either of things past or of

                    For instance, a member of the general assembly is a judge of

                    of the speaker.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Therefore there are necessarily
                    three kinds of rhetorical speeches, deliberative, forensic, and epideictic.
                </p>
                <p>The deliberative kind is either hortatory or dissuasive; for both those who give
                    advice in private and those who speak in the assembly invariably either exhort
                    or dissuade. The forensic kind is either accusatory or defensive; for litigants
                    must necessarily either accuse or defend. The epideictic kind has for its
                    subject praise or blame.

                    </note> for the speaker, whether he exhorts or
                    dissuades, always advises about things to come; to the forensic the past, for it
                    is always in reference to things done that one party accuses and the other
                    defends; to the epideictic most appropriately the present, for it is the
                    existing condition of things that all those who praise or blame have in view. It
                    is not uncommon, however, for epideictic speakers to avail themselves of other
                    times, of the past<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>by way of recalling it, or of the
                    future by way of anticipating it.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Each of the three kinds has a different special
                    end, and as there are three kinds of Rhetoric, so there are three special ends.
                    The end of the deliberative speaker Is the expedient or harmful; for he who
                    exhorts recommends a course of action as better, and he who dissuades advises
                    against it as worse; all other considerations, such as justice and injustice,
                    honor and disgrace, are included as accessory in reference to this. The end of
                    the forensic speaker is the just or the unjust; in this case also all other
                    considerations are included as accessory. The end of those who praise or blame
                    is the honorable and disgraceful; and they also refer all other considerations
                    to these.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>A sign that what I have stated is the
                    end which each has in view is the fact that sometimes the speakers will not
                    dispute about the other points. For example, a man on trial does not always deny
                    that an act has been committed or damage inflicted by him, but he will never
                    admit that the act is unjust; for otherwise a trial would be unnecessary.
                    Similarly, the deliberative orator, although he often sacrifices everything
                    else, will never admit that he is recommending what is inexpedient or is
                    dissuading from what is useful; but often he is quite indifferent about showing
                    that the enslavement of neighboring peoples, even if they have done no harm, is
                    not an act of injustice.

                    impossible can neither have been done nor will be done, but only what is
                    possible, and since what has not taken place nor will take place can neither
                    have been done nor will be done, it is necessary for each of the three kinds of
                    orators to have in readiness propositions dealing with the possible and the
                    impossible, and as to whether anything has taken place or will take place, or
                    not.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Further, since all, whether they praise or
                    blame, exhort or dissuade, accuse or defend, not only endeavor to prove what we
                    have stated, but also that the same things,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>whether good
                    or bad, honorable or disgraceful, just or unjust, are great or small, either in
                    themselves or when compared with each other, it is clear that it will be
                    necessary for the orator to be ready with propositions dealing with greatness
                    and smallness and the greater and the less, both universally and in particular;
                    for instance, which is the greater or less good, or act of injustice or justice;
                    and similarly with regard to all other subjects. We have now stated the topics
                    concerning which the orator must provide himself with propositions; after this,
                    we must distinguish between each of them individually, that is, what the three
                    kinds of Rhetoric, deliberative, epideictic, and forensic, are concerned with.

                    <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>We must first
                    ascertain about what kind of good or bad things the deliberative orator advises,
                    since he cannot do so about everything, but only about things which may possibly
                    happen or not.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Everything which of necessity
                    either is or will be, or which cannot possibly be or come to pass, is outside
                    the scope of deliberation.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Indeed, even in the
                    case of things that are possible advice is not universally appropriate; for they
                    include certain advantages, natural and accidental, about which it is not worth
                    while to offer advice. But it is clear that advice is limited to those subjects
                    about which we take counsel; and such are all those which can naturally be
                    referred to ourselves and the first cause of whose origination is in our own

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>However, there is no need at present to endeavor
                    to enumerate with scrupulous exactness or to classify those subjects which men
                    are wont to discuss, or to define them as far as possible with strict accuracy,
                    since this is not the function of the rhetorical art but of one that is more
                    intelligent and exact, and further, more than its legitimate subjects of inquiry
                    have already been assigned to it.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For what we
                    have said before is true<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The analytical
                        science is Dialectic, incorrectly regarded as a branch of Analytics, which

                    of analytical science and of that branch of political science which is concerned

                    Nevertheless, even at present we may mention such
                    matters as it is worth while to analyze, while still leaving much for political
                    science to investigate.
                </p>
                <p>Now, we may say that the most important subjects about which all men
                    deliberate<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and deliberative orators harangue, are
                    five in number, to wit: ways and means, war and peace, the defence of the
                    country, imports and exports, legislation.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Accordingly, the orator who is going to give
                    advice on ways and means should be acquainted with the nature and extent of the
                    State resources, so that if any is omitted it may be added, and if any is
                    insufficient, it may be increased. Further, he should know all the expenses of
                    the State, that if any is superfluous, it may be removed, or, if too great, may
                    be curtailed. For men become wealthier, not only by adding to what they already
                    possess, but also by cutting down expenses. Of these things it is not only
                    possible to acquire a general view from individual experience, but in view of
                    advising concerning them it is further necessary to be well informed about what
                    has been discovered among others.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In regard to war and peace, the orator should be
                    acquainted with the power of the State, how great it is already and how great it
                    may possibly become; of what kind it is already and what additions may possibly
                    be made to it; further, what wars it has waged and its conduct of them. These
                    things he should be acquainted with, not only as far as his own State is
                    concerned, but also in reference to neighboring States, and particularly those
                    with whom there is a likelihood of war, so that towards the stronger a pacific
                    attitude may be maintained,
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1360a"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and in regard to the weaker, the decision as to making war on them may be
                    left
                    to his own State. Again, he should know whether their forces are like or unlike
                    his own, for herein also advantage or disadvantage may lie. With reference to
                    these matters he must also have examined the results, not only of the wars
                    carried on by his own State, but also of those carried on by others; for similar
                    results naturally arise from similar causes.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Again, in regard to the defense of the country,
                    he should not be ignorant how it is carried on; he should know both the strength
                    of the guard, its character, and the positions of the guard-houses
                    （which is impossible for one who is unacquainted with the
                    country）, so that if any guard is insufficient it may be increased, or
                    if any is superfluous it may be disbanded, and greater attention devoted to
                    suitable positions.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Again, in regard to food, he should know what
                    amount of expenditure is sufficient to support the State; what kind of food is
                    produced at home or can be imported; and what exports and imports are necessary,
                    in order that contracts and agreements may be made with those
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">τούτους</foreign>:
                        those who will

                    who can furnish them; for it is
                    necessary to keep the citizens free from reproach in their relations with two
                    classes of people—those who are stronger and those who are useful for
                    commercial purposes.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>With a view to the safety of the State, it is
                    necessary that the orator should be able to judge of all these questions, but an
                    understanding of legislation is of special importance, for it is on the laws<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>
                    that the safety of the State is based. Wherefore he must
                    know how many forms of government there are; what is expedient for each; and the
                    natural causes of its downfall, whether they are peculiar to the particular form
                    of government or opposed to it. By being ruined by causes peculiar to itself, I
                    mean that, with the exception of the perfect form of government, all the rest
                    are ruined by being relaxed or strained to excess. Thus democracy, not only when
                    relaxed, but also when strained to excess, becomes weaker and will end in an
                    oligarchy; similarly, not only does an aquiline or snub nose reach the mean,
                    when one of these defects is relaxed, but when it becomes aquiline or snub to
                    excess, it is altered to such an extent that even the likeness of a nose is
                    lost.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Moreover, with reference to acts of
                    legislation, it is useful not only to understand what form of government is
                    expedient by judging in the light of the past, but also to become acquainted
                    with those in existence in other nations, and to learn what kinds of government
                    are suitable to what kinds of people. It is clear, therefore, that for
                    legislation books of travel are useful, since they help us to understand the
                    laws of other nations, and for political debates historical works.

                    produce act in three ways; thus, healthiness produces health; and so does food;
                    and exercise as a rule.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This being laid down,
                    it necessarily follows that the acquisition of good things and the loss of evil
                    things are both good; for it follows simultaneously on the latter that we are
                    rid of that which is bad, and subsequently on the former that we obtain
                    possession of that which is good.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The same
                    applies to the acquisition of a greater in place of a less good, and a less in
                    place of a greater evil;

                    in proportion as the greater exceeds the less, there is an acquisition of the

                    must be a good thing; for those who possess them are in a sound condition, and
                    they are also productive of good things and practical. However, we must speak
                    separately concerning each—what it is, and of what kind.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Pleasure
                    also must be a good; for all living creatures
                    naturally desire it. Hence it follows that both agreeable and beautiful things
                    must be good; for the former produce pleasure, while among beautiful things some
                    are pleasant and others are desirable in themselves.

                    and nobler, and goes beyond what is to be expected; for instance, if a man is

                    greater, he is better and more forgiving. Such was the phrase of Iphicrates,

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/>Since praise is founded on actions, and acting
                    according to moral purpose is characteristic of the worthy man, we must endeavor
                    to show that a man is acting in that manner, and it is useful that it should
                    appear that he has done so on several occasions. For this reason also one must
                    assume that accidents and strokes of good fortune are due to moral purpose; for
                    if a number of similar examples can be adduced, they will be thought to be signs
                    of virtue and moral purpose.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Now praise is language that sets forth
                    greatness of virtue; hence it is necessary to show that a man's actions are
                    virtuous. But encomium deals with achievements—all attendant
                    circumstances, such as noble birth and education, merely conduce to persuasion;
                    for it is probable that virtuous parents will have virtuous offspring and that a
                    man will turn out as he has been brought up. Hence we pronounce an encomium upon
                    those who have achieved something. Achievements, in fact, are signs of moral
                    habit; for we should praise even a man who had not achieved anything, if we felt
                    confident that he was likely to do so.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>Blessing and felicitation
                    are identical with each other, but are not the same
                    as praise and encomium, which, as virtue is contained in happiness, are
                    contained in felicitation.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>Praise and counsels have a common aspect; for
                    what you might suggest in counseling becomes encomium by a change in the phrase.
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1368a"/>

                    <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Accordingly, when we know what we ought to do and the qualities we
                    ought to possess, we ought to make a change in the phrase and turn it, employing
                    this knowledge as a suggestion. For instance, the statement that “one
                    ought not to pride oneself on goods which are due to fortune, but on those which
                    are due to oneself alone,” when expressed in this way, has the force
                    of a suggestion; but expressed thus, “he was proud, not of goods which
                    were due to fortune, but of those which were due to himself alone,” it
                    becomes praise. Accordingly, if you desire to praise, look what you would
                    suggest; if you desire to suggest, look what you would praise.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>The
                    form of the expression will necessarily be
                    opposite, when the prohibitive has been changed into the non-prohibitive.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">In the first sentence, the statement is
                        imperative, there is a prohibition; in the second, it is a simple
                        affirmative, implying praise. In the one case there is forbidding, in the
                        other not-forbidding, which are opposites.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/>We must also employ many of the means of
                    amplification; for instance, if a man has done anything alone, or first, or with
                    a few, or has been chiefly responsible for it; all these circumstances render an
                    action noble. Similarly, topics derived from times and seasons, that is to say,
                    if our expectation is surpassed. Also, if a man has often been successful in the
                    same thing; for this is of importance and would appear to be due to the man
                    himself, and not to be the result of chance. And if it is for his sake that
                    distinctions which are an encouragement or honor have been invented and
                    established; and if he was the first on whom an encomium was pronounced, as
                    Hippolochus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Nothing more is known of

                    And similarly
                    in opposite cases. If he does not furnish you with enough material in
                    himself,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>you must compare him with others, as
                    Isocrates used to do, because of his inexperience

                    illustrious personages, for it affords ground for amplification and is noble, if
                    he can be proved better than men of worth.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>Amplification is with
                    good reason ranked as one of the forms of praise, since
                    it consists in superiority, and superiority is one of the things that are noble.
                    That is why, if you cannot compare him with illustrious personages, you must
                    compare him with ordinary persons, since superiority is thought to indicate
                    virtue.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>Speaking generally, of the topics
                    common to all rhetorical arguments, amplification is most suitable for
                    epideictic speakers, whose subject is actions which are not disputed, so that
                    all that remains to be done is to attribute beauty and importance to them.
                    Examples are most suitable for deliberative speakers, for it is by examination
                    of the past that we divine and judge the future. Enthymemes are most suitable
                    for forensic speakers, because the past, by reason of its obscurity, above all
                    lends itself to the investigation of causes and to demonstrative proof.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>Such are nearly all the materials of
                    praise or blame, the things which those who praise or blame should keep in view,
                    and the sources of encomia and invective; for when these are known their
                    contraries are obvious, since blame is derived from the contrary things.

                    Three things have to be considered; first, the nature
                    and the number of the motives which lead men to act unjustly; secondly, what is
                    the state of mind of those who so act; thirdly, the character and dispositions

                <p>Let injustice, then, be defined as voluntarily causing injury contrary to the

                    law in accordance with which a state is administered; by general, the unwritten
                    regulations which appear to be universally recognized. Men act voluntarily when
                    they know what they do, and do not act under compulsion. What is done
                    voluntarily is not always done with premeditation; but what is done with
                    premeditation is always known to the agent, for no one is ignorant of what he
                    does with a purpose.

                    wrong and of those who suffer from it.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>First,
                    then, let us decide what those who set about doing wrong long for or avoid; for
                    it is evident that the accuser must examine the number and nature of the motives
                    which are to be found in his opponent; the defendant, which of them are not to

                    compulsion, others to nature, so that the things which men do not do of
                    themselves are all the result of chance, nature, or compulsion. As for those

                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>some are the result of habit, others of

                    will be the mainspring of their action. Similarly, the just and the unjust, and
                    all the others who are said to act in accordance with their moral habits, will
                    act from the same causes, either from reason or emotion, but some from good
                    characters and emotions, and others from the opposite.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Not but that
                    it does happen<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that such and
                    such moral habits are followed by such and such consequences; for it may be that
                    from the outset the fact of being temperate produces in the temperate man good
                    opinions and desires in the matter of pleasant things, in the intemperate man

                    distinctions on one side, but we must examine what are the usual consequences of
                    certain conditions. For, if a man is fair or dark, tall or short, there is no
                    rule that any such consequences should follow, but if he is young or old, just
                    or unjust, it does make a difference. In a word, it will be necessary to take
                    account of all the circumstances that make men's characters different; for
                    instance, if a man fancies himself rich or poor, fortunate or unfortunate, it
                    will make a difference. We will, however, discuss this later<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"

                    </note> Desire is the cause of things being done that are apparently
                    pleasant. The things which are familiar and to which we have become accustomed
                    are among pleasant things; for men do with pleasure many things which are not
                    naturally pleasant, when they have become accustomed to them.
                </p>
                <p>In short, all things that men do of themselves either are, or seem,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>good or
                    pleasant; and since men do voluntarily what they
                    do of themselves, and involuntarily what they do not, it follows that all that
                    men do voluntarily will be either that which is or seems good, or that which is
                    or seems pleasant. For I reckon among good things the removal of that which is
                    evil or seems evil, or the exchange of a greater evil for a less, because these
                    two things are in a way desirable; in like manner, I reckon among pleasant
                    things the removal of that which is or appears painful, and the exchange of a
                    greater pain for a less. We must therefore make ourselves acquainted with the
                    number and quality of expedient and pleasant things.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>We have

                    remembers and the man who hopes will be attended by an imagination of what he

                        conclusion then drawn is that memory and hope are accompanied by imagination
                        of what is remembered or hoped. To this it is objected that what Aristotle
                        really wants to prove is that memory and hope are a cause of pleasure.
                        （2） With a comma at <foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίζει</foreign> （Cope, Victorius）. The steps in the
                        argument will then be: if pleasure is the sensation of a certain emotion; if
                        imagination is a weakened （faded） sensation; if one who
                        remembers or hopes is attended by an imagination of what he remembers or
                        hopes; then, this being so, pleasure will attend one who remembers or hopes,
                        since there is sensation, and pleasure is sensation and a kind of movement
                        （sect. 1）. <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, the
                        faculty of forming mental images （variously translated
                        “imagination,” “mental impression,”
                        “fantasy”） is defined by Aristotle
                        （<bibl n="Aristot. de An. 3.3.11" default="NO">Aristot. De Anima
                            3.3.11</bibl>） as a <emph>kind of movement</emph>, which cannot
                        arise apart from sensation, and the movement produced must resemble the
                        sensation which produced it. But
                        <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>
                        is more than this; it is not merely a faculty of sense, but occupies a place
                        midway between sense and intellect; while imagination has need of the
                        senses, the intellect has need of imagination. If <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> is
                        referred to an earlier perception of which the
                        sense image is a copy, this is memory. Imagination carries the sense images
                        （ <foreign lang="greek">φαντάσματα</foreign>） to the seat
                        of memory. They are then transformed into memory （of something
                        past） or hope （of something future） and are
                        handed on to the intellect. （See Cope here, and R. D. Hicks in his

                    This being so, it
                    is evident that there is pleasure both for those who remember and for those who
                    hope, since there is sensation.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Therefore all
                    pleasant things must either be present in sensation, or past in recollection, or

                    of the charge or the point on which it turns—for instance, admits that
                    he took something, but did not steal it; that he was the first to strike, but
                    committed no outrage; that he had relations, but did not commit adultery, with a
                    woman; or that he stole something but was not guilty of sacrilege, since the
                    object in question was not consecrated; or that he trespassed, but not on public
                    land; or that he held converse with the enemy, but was not guilty of
                    treason—for this reason it will be necessary that a definition should
                    be given of theft, outrage, or adultery, in order that, if we desire to prove
                    that an offence has or has not been committed, we may be able to put the case in

                    question at issue is to know whether the supposed offender is a wrongdoer and a

                    and such terms as outrage and theft further indicate purpose; for if a man has
                    struck, it does not in all cases follow that he has committed an outrage, but
                    only if he has struck with a certain object, for instance, to bring disrepute
                    upon the other or to please himself. Again, if a man has taken something by
                    stealth, it is by no means certain that he has committed theft, but only if he
                    has taken it to injure another

                    Wrong acts are judged greater sometimes in this way, sometimes by the extent of
                    the injury done.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A wrong act is greater when
                    there is no adequate punishment for it, but all are insufficient; when there is
                    no remedy, because it is difficult if not impossible to repair it;

                    if the sufferer, having been wronged, has
                    inflicted some terrible injury upon himself, the guilty person deserves greater
                    punishment; wherefore Sophocles,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">An orator,

                    also greater when it is unprecedented, or the first of
                    its kind, or when committed with the aid of few accomplices<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"

                    the citizen owing to whom a new law has been passed, is punished, as well as
                    those on whose account a new prison had to be built.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The crime is
                    greater, the more brutal it is; or when it has been for
                    a long time premeditated; when the recital of it inspires terror rather than
                    pity. Rhetorical tricks of the following kind may be used:—the
                    statement that the accused person has swept away or violated several principles
                    of justice, for example, oaths, pledges of friendship, plighted word, the
                    sanctity of marriage; for this amounts to heaping crime upon crime.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                    Wrong acts are greater when committed in the very
                    place where wrongdoers themselves are sentenced, as is done by false witnesses;
                    for where would a man not commit wrong, if he does so in a court of justice?
                    They are also greater when accompanied by the greatest disgrace; when committed
                    against one who has been the guilty person's benefactor, for in that case, the
                    wrongdoer is guilty of wrong twice over, in that he not only does wrong, but
                    does not return good for good.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>So too, again,
                    when a man offends against the unwritten laws of right, for there is greater

                    written laws involve compulsion, the unwritten do not. Looked at in another way,
                    wrongdoing is greater, if it violates the written laws; for a man who commits
                    wrongs that alarm him<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">When he thinks of the

                    suffice for the treatment of the greater or less degree of wrongdoing.

                    is contradictory to another approved law or to itself; for instance, one law

                    contracts contrary to the law.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>If the meaning
                    of the law is equivocal, we must turn it about, and see in which way it is to be

                    recourse to that.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>If the conditions which led

                    must say that the oath of the dicast “to decide to the best of his

                    is only intended to relieve him from the charge of perjury, if he is ignorant of
                    the meaning of the law; that no one chooses that which is good absolutely, but
                    that which is good for himself;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that there is no

                    an error on his part does not do so much harm as the habit of disobeying the
                    authority; that to seek to be wiser than the laws is just what is forbidden in

                        commander, both naval and military. Nothing is known of Archibius. Plato is
                        probably the comic poet.

                    question of the quality of the act, for instance, whether it is just or unjust,

                    ancient witnesses are the most trustworthy of all, for they cannot be corrupted.
                    In regard to the confirmation of evidence, when a man has no witnesses, he can
                    say that the decision should be given in accordance with probabilities, and that
                    this is the meaning of the oath “according to the best of one's
                    judgement”; that probabilities cannot<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>be bribed
                    to deceive, and that they cannot be convicted of bearing false witness. But if a
                    man has witnesses and his adversary has none, he can say that probabilities
                    incur no responsibility, and that there would have been no need of evidence, if
                    an investigation according to the arguments were sufficient.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
                    Evidence partly concerns ourselves, partly our
                    adversary, as to the fact itself or moral character; so that it is evident that
                    one never need lack useful evidence. For, if we have no evidence as to the fact
                    itself, neither in confirmation of our own case nor against our opponent, it
                    will always be possible to obtain some evidence as to character that will
                    establish either our own respectability or the worthlessness of our opponent.

                    a witness, whether he is a friend, an enemy, or neutral, of good or bad or
                    middling reputation, and for all other differences of this kind, we must have
                    recourse to the same topics as those from which we derive our enthymemes.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>As for contracts, argument may be used to the
                    extent of magnifying or minimizing their importance, of proving that they do or
                    do not deserve credit.
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1376b"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>If we
                    have them on our side, we must try to prove them worthy of credit and
                    authoritative; but if they are on the side of our opponent, we must do the
                    opposite.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>In view of rendering them worthy or
                    unworthy of credit, the method of procedure is exactly the same as in the case
                    of witnesses; for contracts are trustworthy according to the character of their
                    signatories or depositaries. When the existence of the contract is admitted, if
                    it is in our favor, we must strengthen it by asserting that the contract is a
                    law, special and partial; and it is not the contracts that make the law
                    authoritative, but it is the laws that give force to legal contracts. And in a
                    general sense the law itself is a kind of contract, so that whoever disobeys or
                    subverts a contract, subverts the laws.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Further, most ordinary and
                    all voluntary transactions are carried out
                    according to contract; so that if you destroy the authority of contracts, the
                    mutual intercourse of men is destroyed. All other arguments suitable to the
                    occasion are easy to see.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>But if the contract
                    is against us and in favor of our opponents, in the first place those arguments
                    are suitable which we should oppose to the law if it were against us; that it
                    would be strange if, while we consider ourselves entitled to refuse to obey
                    ill-made laws, whose authors have erred, we should be obliged to consider
                    ourselves always bound by contracts.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Or, that
                    the judge<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>is the dispenser of justice; so that it is not
                    the contents of the contract that he has to consider, but what is juster.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Further, that one cannot alter justice
                    either by fraud or compulsion, for it is based upon nature, whereas contracts
                    may be entered into under both conditions. In addition to this, we must examine
                    whether the contract is contrary to any written law of our own or foreign
                    countries, or to any general law, or to other previous or subsequent contracts.
                    For either the latter are valid and the former not, or the former are right and
                    the latter fraudulent; we may put it in whichever way it seems fit. We must also
                    consider the question of expediency—whether the contract is in any way
                    opposed to the interest of the judges. There are a number of other arguments of
                    the same kind, which are equally easy to discern.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Torture is a kind of evidence, which appears
                    trustworthy, because a sort of compulsion is attached to it. Nor is it difficult
                    to see what may be said concerning it, and by what arguments, if it is in our
                    favor, we can exaggerate its importance by asserting that it is the only true
                    kind of evidence;
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1377a"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but if it is
                    against us and in favor of our opponent, we can destroy its value by telling the
                    truth about all kinds of torture generally; for those under compulsion are as
                    likely to give false evidence as true, some being ready to endure everything
                    rather than tell the truth, while others are equally ready to make false charges
                    against others, in the hope of being sooner released from torture. It is also
                    necessary to be able to quote actual examples of the kind with which the judges
                    are acquainted. It may also be said that evidence given under torture is not
                    true; for many thick-witted and thick-skinned persons, and those who are
                    stout-hearted heroically hold out under sufferings, while the cowardly and
                    cautious, before they see the sufferings before them, are bold enough; wherefore
                    evidence from torture may be considered utterly untrustworthy.

                    either tender but do not accept, or accept but do not tender. Besides this, one
                    may consider whether the oath has already been taken by us or by the other

                    may argue that the oath is only taken with a view to money; that, if you had
                    been a scoundrel, you would have taken it at once, for it is better to be a
                    scoundrel for something than for nothing; that, if you take it, you will win

                    “They demand that you abide by your oath as judges, while they
