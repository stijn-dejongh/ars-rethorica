                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such then are
                    the materials which we must employ in exhorting and dissuading, praising and
                    blaming, accusing and defending, and such are the opinions and propositions that
                    are useful to produce conviction in these circumstances; for they are the
                    subject and source of enthymemes,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>which are specially
                    suitable to each class （so to say） of speeches.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">This is Cope's interpretation. Jebb renders:
                        “If we take each branch of Rhetoric by itself.” The
                        classes are of course the deliberative, forensic, and epideictic.
                    </note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But since the object of Rhetoric is
                    judgement—for judgements are pronounced in deliberative rhetoric and
                    judicial proceedings are a judgement—it is not only necessary to
                    consider how to make the speech itself demonstrative and convincing, but also
                    that the speaker should show himself to be of a certain character and should
                    know how to put the judge into a certain frame of mind.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For it makes
                    a great difference with regard to
                    producing conviction—especially in demonstrative, and, next to this,
                    in forensic oratory—that the speaker should show himself to be
                    possessed of certain qualities and that his hearers should think that he is
                    disposed in a certain way towards them; and further, that they themselves should
                    be disposed in a certain way towards him.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The
                        instructions given for enthymematic or logical proof should suffice; but
                        since the function of Rhetoric is to find the available means of persuasion
                        and its end is a judgement; and since an appeal to the speaker's own
                        character and to the passions of those who are to give the judgement is
                        bound to carry great weight, the speaker must be provided with rules for
                        ethical and “pathetic” （emotional）
                        proofs. In Book 1.5 Aristotle mentions appeals to the emotions with
                        disapproval, but this does not apply to all such appeals, but only to those
                        which are likely to bias the judges unfairly （e.g. stirring up
                        envy, hatred, a desire for revenge）.
                    </note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In deliberative oratory, it is more useful that
                    the orator should appear to be of a certain character, in forensic, that the
                    hearer should be disposed in a certain way; for opinions vary, according as men
                    love or hate, are wrathful or mild,
                    <pb ed="Bekker" n="1378a"/>
                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and things appear either altogether different, or different in
                    degree; for when a man is favorably disposed towards one on whom he is passing
                    judgement, he either thinks that the accused has committed no wrong at all or
                    that his offence is trifling; but if he hates him, the reverse is the case. And
                    if a man desires anything and has good hopes of getting it, if what is to come
                    is pleasant, he thinks that it is sure to come to pass and will be good; but if
                    a man is unemotional or not hopeful

                    it is quite the reverse.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For the orator to produce conviction three
                    qualities are necessary; for, independently of demonstrations, the things which
                    induce belief are three in number. These qualities are good sense, virtue, and
                    goodwill; for speakers are wrong both in what they say and in the advice they
                    give, because they lack either all three or one of them.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For either
                    through want of sense they form incorrect
                    opinions, or, if their opinions are correct, through viciousness they do not say
                    what they think, or, if they are sensible and good,

                    they lack goodwill; wherefore it may happen that they do not give the best
                    advice, although they know what it is. These qualities are all that are
                    necessary, so that the speaker who appears to possess all three will necessarily
                    convince his hearers.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The means whereby he may
                    appear sensible and good<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">See previous

                    </note> for to make himself appear
                    such he would employ the same means as he would in the case of others. We must
                    now speak of goodwill and friendship in our discussion of the emotions.

                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The emotions are all those affections which
                    cause men to change their opinion in regard to their judgements, and are
                    accompanied by pleasure and pain; such are anger, pity, fear, and all similar
                    emotions and their contraries.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And each of them
                    must be divided under three heads; for instance, in regard to anger, the
                    disposition of mind which makes men angry, the persons with whom they are
                    usually angry, and the occasions which give rise to anger. For if we knew one or
                    even two of these heads, but not all three, it would be impossible to arouse
                    that emotion. The same applies to the rest. Just as, then, we have given a list
                    of propositions<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">In Book 1 generally
                        （cp. 1.2.22）.
                    </note> in what we have previously said, we
                    will do the same here and divide the emotions in the same manner.

                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us then
                    define anger as a longing, accompanied by pain, for a real or apparent revenge
                    for a real or apparent slight,
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Gomperz

                        “apparent”; Cope confines both to the meaning
                        “manifest.”

                    this definition is correct, the angry man must always be angry with a particular
                    individual （for instance, with Cleon, but not with men
                    generally）,

                    because this individual has done, or was on the point of doing, something
                    against him or one of his friends; and lastly, anger is always accompanied by a
                    certain pleasure, due to the hope of revenge to come. For it is pleasant to
                    think that one will obtain what one aims at; now, no one aims at what is
                    obviously impossible of attainment by him, and the angry man aims at what is
                    possible for himself. Wherefore it has been well said of anger, that

                    That is why the young and the wealthy are given to insults; for they think that,

                    recognize that they are inferior; now, those who are inferior are afraid, and no
                    one who is afraid slights another. Even the behavior of dogs proves that anger
                    ceases towards those who humble themselves, for they do not bite those who sit

                    they must be examined in the light of their contraries. The causes which produce
                    enmity are anger, spitefulness, slander.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Anger
                    arises from acts committed against us, enmity even from those that are not; for
                    if we imagine a man to be of such and such a character, we hate him. Anger has
                    always an individual as its object, for instance Callias or

                    , whereas
                    hatred applies to classes; for instance, every one hates a thief or informer.
                    Anger is curable by time, hatred not; the aim of anger is pain, of hatred evil;
                    for the angry man wishes to see what happens;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">

                    pain. Anger is accompanied by pain, but hatred not; for he who is angry suffers
                    pain, but he who hates does not. One who is angry might feel compassion in many
                    cases, but one who hates, never; for the former wishes that the object of his

                    say, nearly all the most important things which are to be feared and which men
                    fear. Let us now state the frame of mind which leads men to fear.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>If then fear is accompanied by the expectation
                    that we are going to suffer some fatal misfortune, it is evident that none of
                    those who think that they will suffer nothing at all is afraid either of those
                    things which he does not think will happen to him, or of those from whom he does
                    not expect them, or at a time when he does not think them likely to happen. It
                    therefore needs be that those who think they are likely to suffer anything
                    should be afraid, either of the persons at whose hands they expect it, or of

                    they are insolent, contemptuous, and rash, and what makes them such is wealth,
                    strength, a number of friends, power. It is the same with those who think that
                    they have already suffered all possible ills and are coldly indifferent to the
                    future, like those who are being beaten to death; for it is a necessary
                    incentive to fear that there should remain some hope of being saved from the
                    cause of their distress. A sign of this is that fear makes men deliberate,
                    whereas no one deliberates about things that are hopeless.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>So that
                    whenever it is preferable that the audience

                    suffer, by reminding them that others greater than they have suffered, and
                    showing that their equals are suffering or have suffered, and that at the hands
                    of those from whom they did not expect it, in such a manner and at times when

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Now, since we have made clear what fear and
                    fearful things are, and the frame of mind in each case which makes men fear, one
                    can see from this what confidence is, what are the things that give it, and the
                    frame of mind of those who possess it; for confidence is the contrary of fear
                    and that which gives confidence of that which causes fear, so that the hope of
                    what is salutary is accompanied by an impression that it is quite near at hand,
                    while the things to be feared are either non-existent or far off.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
                    Confidence is inspired by the remoteness of fearful
                    things,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or by the nearness of things that justify
                    it.

                    it; for men are unaffected by fear in two ways, either because they have never
                    been tested or have means of help; thus, in dangers at sea, those who have never

                    for all these are signs of stinginess.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And to
                    praise people when they are present, to overpraise their good qualities and to
                    palliate the bad, to show excessive grief at another's grief when present, and

                    for this is a sign of boastfulness. Similarly, in regard to each of all the

                    things which resemble them, all these are disgraceful, and should make us

                    these things are the more disgraceful, if the fault appears to be our own; for

                    persons excite pity, and the state of mind of those who feel it.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let
                    pity then be a kind of pain excited by the sight
                    of evil, deadly or painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it; an evil
                    which one might expect to come upon himself or one of his friends, and when it
                    seems near. For it is evident that one who is likely to feel pity must be such
                    as to think that he, or one of his friends, is liable to suffer some evil, and
                    such an evil as has been stated in the definition, or one similar, or nearly
                    similar.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Wherefore neither those who are
                    utterly ruined,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>are capable of pity, for they think they
                    have nothing more to suffer, since they have exhausted suffering; nor those who
                    think themselves supremely fortunate, who rather are insolent. For if they think
                    that all good things are theirs, it is clear that they think that they cannot
                    possibly suffer evil, and this is one of the good things.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now those
                    persons who think they are likely to suffer
                    are those who have already suffered and escaped; the advanced in age, by reason
                    of their wisdom and experience; and the weak, and those who are rather more
                    timid; and the educated, for they reckon rightly;<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and those who have
                    parents, children, or wives, for these are part of
                    them and likely to suffer the evils of which we have spoken;<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and
                    those who are not influenced by any courageous
                    emotion, such as anger or confidence, for these emotions do not take thought of
                    the future and those who are not in a wantonly insolent frame of mind, for they
                    also take no thought of future suffering; but it is those who are between the
                    two extremes that feel pity. Those who are not in great fear; for those who are
                    panic-stricken are incapable of pity, because they are preoccupied with their
                    own emotion.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And men feel pity if they think
                    that some persons are virtuous; for he who thinks that no one is will think that
                    all deserve misfortune.

                    <lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>And,
                    generally speaking, a man is moved to pity when he is so affected that he
                    remembers that such evils have happened, or expects that they may happen, either
                    to himself or to one of his friends.

                    to pity; and the things which arouse this feeling are clearly shown by the
                    definition. They are all painful and distressing things that are also
                    destructive, and all that are ruinous; and all evils of which fortune is the
                    cause, if they are great.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Things distressing
                    and destructive are various kinds of death, personal ill-treatment and injuries,
                    old age, disease, and lack of food.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The evils
                    for which fortune is responsible are lack of friends, or few friends
                    （wherefore it is pitiable to be torn away from friends and
                    intimates）, ugliness, weakness, mutilation; if some misfortune comes to

                    fortune does not come until a man has already suffered, as when the presents
                    from the Great King were not dispatched to Diopithes until he was dead. Those
                    also are to be pitied to whom no good has ever accrued, or who are unable to
                    enjoy it when it has.
                </p>
                <p>These and the like things, then, excite pity.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The persons men pity
                    are those whom they know, provided they are not too
                    closely connected with them for if they are, they feel the same as if they

                    is said not

                    friend reduced to beggary, for the latter excited pity, the former terror. The
                    terrible is different from the pitiable, for it drives out pity, and often
                    serves to produce the opposite feeling.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Further, the nearness of
                    the terrible makes men pity.
                    <note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Jebb renders: “Again men pity when the danger
                        is

                    Men also pity those who resemble them in

                    more likely to think that their misfortune may befall him as well. For, in
                    general, here also we may conclude that all that men fear in regard to

                    since sufferings are pitiable when they appear

                    or forwards, either do not excite pity at all or only in a less degree, because
                    men neither expect the one nor remember the other, it follows that those who
                    contribute to the effect by gestures, voice, dress, and dramatic action
                    generally, are more pitiable; for they make the evil appear close at hand,

                    envy also is similarly opposed to pity, as being
                    akin to or identical with indignation, although it is really different; envy
                    also is indeed a disturbing pain and directed against good fortune, but not that
                    of one who does not deserve it, but of one who is our equal and<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>like. Now,
                    all who feel envy and indignation must have this in
                    common, that they are disturbed, not because they think that any harm will
                    happen to themselves, but on account of their neighbor; for it will cease to be
                    indignation and envy, but will be fear, if the pain and disturbance arise from
                    the idea that harm may come to themselves from another's good fortune.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And it is evident that these feelings will
                    be accompanied by opposite feelings; for he who is pained at the sight of those

                    the sight of those who are deservedly so; for instance, no good man would be
                    pained at seeing parricides or assassins punished; we should rather rejoice at
                    their lot, and at that of men who are deservedly fortunate; for both these

                    these feelings arise from the same character
                    and their contraries from the contrary; for he who is malicious is also envious,

                    emotions are a hindrance to pity, although they differ for the reasons stated;

                    mind in which men feel emulation, what things and persons give rise to it, will
                    be clear from the following considerations. Let us assume that emulation is a
                    feeling of pain at the evident presence of highly valued goods, which are
                    possible for us to obtain, in the possession of those who naturally resemble
                    us—pain not due to the fact that another possesses them, but to the
                    fact that we ourselves do not. Emulation therefore is virtuous and
                    characteristic of virtuous men, whereas envy is base and characteristic of base
                    men; for the one, owing to emulation, fits himself to obtain such goods, while
                    the object of the other, owing to envy, is to prevent his neighbor possessing
                    them.

                    men, which include wealth, a number of friends, positions of office, and all
                    similar things. For, believing it their duty to be good, because such goods
                    naturally belong to those who are good, they strive to preserve them. And those
                    are emulous, whom others think worthy of them.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Honors obtained by

                    if highly valued goods are the object of emulation, it necessarily follows that
                    the virtues must be such and all things that are useful and beneficial to the
                    rest of mankind, for benefactors and virtuous men are honored; to these we may
                    add all the goods which our neighbors can enjoy with us, such as wealth and

                    property is one of these necessaries, and at the same time, they know from

                    selfish, for this also is littleness of mind. And they
                    live not for the noble, but for the useful, more than they ought, because they
                    are selfish;

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And they are rather shameless than modest; for
                    since they do not care for the noble so much as for the useful, they pay little
                    attention to what people think.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And they are
                    little given to hope owing to their experience, for things that happen are
                    mostly bad and at all events generally turn out for the worse, and also owing to
                    their cowardice.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>They live in memory rather
                    than in hope; for the life that remains to them is short, but that which is past
                    is long, and hope belongs to the future, memory to the past. This is the reason
                    of their loquacity; for they are incessantly talking of the past, because they
                    take pleasure in recollection.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Their outbursts
                    of anger are violent, but feeble; of their desires some have ceased, while
                    others are weak, so that they neither feel them nor act in accordance with them,
                    but only from motives of gain. Hence men of this age are regarded as
                    self-controlled, for their desires have slackened, and they are slaves to gain.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>In their manner of life there is more
                    calculation than moral character, for calculation is concerned with that which
                    is useful, moral character with virtue. If they commit acts of injustice it is
                    due to vice rather than to insolence.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>The old,
                    like the young, are inclined to pity, but not for the same reason; the latter
                    show pity<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>from humanity, the former from weakness,
                    because they think that they are on the point of suffering all kinds of
                    misfortunes, and this is one of the reasons that incline men to pity. That is
                    why the old are querulous, and neither witty nor fond of laughter; for a
                    querulous disposition is the opposite of a love of laughter.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Such
                    are the characters of the young and older men.
                    Wherefore, since all men are willing to listen to speeches which harmonize with

                    whereas in the young and old these qualities are found separately; for the young
                    are courageous but without self-control, the old are self-controlled but
                    cowardly. Speaking generally, all the advantages that youth and old age possess
                    separately, those in the prime of life possess combined; and all cases of excess
                    or defect in the other two are replaced by due moderation and fitness.

                    which accompany wealth are plain for all to see. The wealthy are insolent and
                    arrogant, being mentally affected by the acquisition of wealth, for they seem to
                    think that they possess all good things;

                    and swaggerers, luxurious because of their luxury
                    and the display of their prosperity, swaggerers and ill-mannered because all men
                    are accustomed to devote their attention to what they like and admire, and the
                    rich suppose that what they themselves are emulous of is the object of all other
                    men's emulation. At the same time this feeling is not unreasonable; for those
                    who have need of the wealthy are many in number. Hence the answer of Simonides
                    to the wife of Hiero concerning the wise and the rich, when she asked which was

                    the employment of persuasive speeches is
                    directed towards a judgement; for when a thing is known and judged, there is no
                    longer any need of argument. And there is judgement, whether a speaker addresses
                    himself to a single individual and makes use of his speech to exhort or
                    dissuade, as those do who give advice or try to persuade, for this single
                    individual is equally a judge, since, speaking generally, he who has to be
                    persuaded is a judge; if the speaker is arguing against an opponent or against
                    some theory, it is just the same, for it is necessary to make use of speech to
                    destroy the opposing arguments, against which he speaks as if they were the
                    actual opponent; and similarly in epideictic speeches, for the speech is put
                    together with reference to the spectator as if he were a judge. Generally
                    speaking, however, only he who decides questions at issue in civil
                    controversies<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Both forensic and

                </note> is a judge in the proper sense of the word, for in
                    judicial cases the point at issue is the state of the case, in deliberative the
                    subjects of deliberation.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Or, “for

                    end, and in regard to all of them we have gathered popular opinions and premises
                    whence men derive their proofs in deliberative, epideictic, and judicial

                    <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For all orators are obliged, in their
                    speeches, also to make use of the topic of the possible and impossible, and to

                    happened.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Further, the topic of magnitude is
                    common to all kinds of Rhetoric, for all men employ extenuation or amplification
                    whether deliberating, praising or blaming, accusing or defending.

                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us first
                    speak of the possible and the impossible. If of two contrary things it is
                    possible that one should exist or come into existence, then it would seem that
                    the other is equally possible; for instance, if a man can be cured, he can also
                    be ill; for the potentiality of contraries, <emph>qua</emph> contraries, is the
                    same.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">As a general rule, from their nature

                    make him more liable to one or the other, e.g. he may suffer from an
                    incurable disease （Schrader）.

                    <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And if it is possible for a thing to be
                    made excellent or beautiful,<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>it is possible for
                    it to be made in general; for it is harder for a beautiful house to be made than

                    <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Again, if the beginning is possible, so also is
                    the end; for no impossible thing comes, or begins to come, into existence; for
                    instance, that the diameter of a square should be commensurable with the side of
                    a square is neither possible nor could be possible. And when the end is
                    possible, so also is the beginning; for all things arise from a beginning.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And if that which is subsequent in<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>being or
                    generation can come into being, so then can
                    that which is antecedent; for instance, if a man can come into being, so can a
                    child, for the child is antecedent; and similarly, if a child can come into
                    being, so can a man, for the child is a beginning.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And things which
                    we love or desire naturally are possible; for as a

                    which form the subject of sciences or arts can also exist and

                    masters, or friends we are.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And if the parts
                    are possible, so also is the whole; and if the whole is possible, so also are
                    the parts, speaking generally; for instance, if the front, toe-cap, and upper
                    leather,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The meaning of the Greek words is

                    to be made, so is the species, and if the species, so the genus; for example, if

                    impossible, it is clear that there is a supply of arguments to be derived from
                    the opposite of what has been said about the possible.
                </p>
                <p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>The question whether a thing has or has not
                    happened must be considered from the following points of view.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>In
                    the first place, if that which is naturally less
                    likely has happened, then that which is more likely will most probably have
                    happened. If that which usually happens afterwards has happened, then that which
                    precedes must also have happened; for instance, if a man has forgotten a thing,
                    he must once have learnt it.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>If a man was able
                    and wished to do a thing, he has done it; for all men<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>do
                    a thing, when they are able and resolve to do it, for nothing hinders them.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Further, if a man wished to do it and
                    there was no external obstacle; if he was able to do it and was in a state of
                    anger; if he was able and desired to do it; for men as a rule, whenever they
                    can, do those things which they long for, the vicious owing to want of
                    self-control, the virtuous because they desire what is good.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And if
                    anything was on the point of being done, it
                    most probably was done; for it is likely that one who was on the point of doing
                    something has carried it out.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And if all the
                    natural antecedents or causes of a thing have happened; for instance, if it has
                    lightened, it has also thundered; and if a man has already attempted a crime, he
                    has also committed it. And if all the natural consequences or motives of actions
                    have happened, then the antecedent or the cause has happened; for instance, if
                    it has thundered, it has also lightened, and if a man has committed a crime, he
                    has also attempted it.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Of all these things
                    some are so related necessarily, others only as a general rule. To establish
                    that a thing has not happened, it is evident that our argument must be derived
                    from the opposite of what has been said.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>In regard to the future, it is clear that one
                    can argue in the same way; for if we are able and wish to do a thing, it will be
                    done; and so too will those things which desire, anger, and reasoning urge us to
                    do, if we have the power. For this reason also, if a man has an eager desire, or
                    intention, of doing a thing, it will probably be done; since, as a rule, things
                    that are about to happen are more likely to happen than those which are not.
                    <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And if all the natural antecedents have
                    happened; for instance, if the sky is cloudy, it will probably rain.<milestone unit="section"

                    thing has been done with a view to
                    another, it is probable that the latter will also be done; for instance, if a
                    foundation has been laid, a house will probably be built.

                <p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>What we have previously said clearly shows the
                    nature of the greatness and smallness of things, of the greater and less, and of
                    things great and small generally. For, when treating of deliberative
                    rhetoric,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Book 1.7.</note> we spoke of
                    greatness of goods, and of the greater and less generally. Therefore, since in
                    each branch of Rhetoric the end set before it is a good, such as the expedient,
                    the noble, or the just, it is evident that all must take the materials of

                    Let this suffice for the possible and impossible; for
                    the question whether a thing has happened, or will happen, or not; and for the

                    For Stesichorus, when the people of Himera had chosen Phalaris dictator and were
                    on the point of giving him a body-guard, after many arguments related a fable to
                    them: “A horse was in sole occupation of a meadow. A stag having come
                    and done much damage to the pasture, the horse, wishing to avenge himself on the
                    stag, asked a man whether he could help him to punish the stag. The man
                    consented, on condition that the horse submitted to the bit and allowed him to
                    mount him javelins in hand. The horse agreed to the terms and the man mounted
                    him, but instead of obtaining vengeance on the stag, the horse from that time
                    became the man's slave. So then,” said he, “do you take care
                    lest, in your desire to avenge yourselves on the enemy,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>you be treated like
                    the horse. You already have the bit, since you have chosen
                    a dictator; if you give him a body-guard and allow him to mount you, you will at
                    once be the slaves of Phalaris.”<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Aesop, when defending at <placeName

                    demagogue who was being tried for his life, related the following anecdote.
                    “A fox, while crossing a river, was driven into a ravine. Being unable
                    to get out, she was for a long time in sore distress, and a number of dog-fleas
                    clung to her skin. A hedgehog, wandering about, saw her and, moved with
                    compassion, asked her if he should remove the fleas. The fox refused and when
                    the hedgehog asked the reason, she answered: ‘They are already full of
                    me and draw little blood; but if you take them away, others will come that are
                    hungry and will drain what remains to me.’ You in like manner, O
                    Samians, will suffer no more harm from this man, for he is wealthy; but if you
                    put him to death,

                    and they have this advantage that, while it is difficult to find similar things
                    that have really happened in the past, it is easier to invent fables; for they
                    must be invented, like comparisons, if a man is capable of seizing the analogy;
                    and this is easy if one studies philosophy.

                    to say that one should not always nourish immortal wrath is a maxim,
                    but the addition “being a mortal” states the reason. It is

                    them in each case. For in the case of matters of dispute or what is contrary to
                    the general opinion, the epilogue is necessary; but either the epilogue may be
                    put first and the conclusion used as a maxim, as, for example, if one were to
                    say, “As for me, since one ought neither to be the object of jealousy
                    nor to be idle, I say that children ought not to be educated”; or put
                    the maxim first and append the epilogue. In all cases where the statements made,
                    although not paradoxical, are obscure, the reason should be added as concisely
                    as possible.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In such cases Laconic apophthegms

                    advanced in years, and in regard to things in which one has experience; since
                    the use of maxims before such an age is unseemly, as also is story-telling; and
                    to speak about things of which one has no experience shows foolishness and lack
                    of education. A sufficient proof of this is that rustics especially are fond of
                    coining maxims and ready to make display of them.

                    to the most popular sayings, such as “Know thyself” and
                    “Nothing in excess,” either when one's character is thereby
                    likely to appear better, or if they are expressed in the language of passion. It
                    would be an instance of the latter if a man in a rage were to say, “It
                    is not true that a man should know himself; at any rate, such a man as this, if
                    he had known himself, would never have claimed the chief command.” And
                    one's character would appear better, if one were to say that it is not right, as
                    men say, to love as if one were bound to hate, but rather to hate as if one were
                    bound to love.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The moral purpose also should
                    be made clear by the language, or else one should add the reason; for example,
                    either by saying “that it is right to love, not as men say, but as if
                    one were going to love for ever, for the other kind of love would imply
                    treachery”; or thus, “The maxim does not please me, for the
                    true friend should love as if he were going to love for ever. Nor do I approve
                    the maxim ‘Nothing in excess,’ for one cannot hate the

                    </note> What I mean will be clear from the following, and also how one
                    should hunt for maxims. The maxim, as we have said, is a statement of the
                    general; accordingly, the hearers are pleased to hear stated in general terms
                    the opinion which they have already specially formed. For instance, a man who
                    happened to have bad neighbors or children would welcome any one's statement
                    that nothing is more troublesome than neighbors or more stupid than to beget
                    children. Wherefore the speaker should endeavor to guess how his hearers formed
                    their preconceived opinions and what they are, and then express himself in
                    general terms in regard to them.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>This is one
                    of the advantages of the use of maxims, but another is greater; for it makes
                    speeches ethical. Speeches have this character, in which the moral purpose is
                    clear. And this is the effect of all maxims, because he who employs them in a
                    general manner declares his moral preferences; if then the maxims are good, they
                    show the speaker also to be a man of good character. Let this suffice for what
                    we had to say concerning maxims, their nature, how many kinds of them there are,
                    the way they should be used, and what their advantages are.

                    belongs, or appears to belong to him, in order that we may praise or censure in

                    between having ordered and having carried out, as Diomedon the tax-gatherer said

                    justly, he has suffered justly, but perhaps not at your hands. Wherefore one
                    must consider separately whether the sufferer deserves to suffer,

                    foresee as soon as they are begun, and not because they are superficial
                    （for as they listen they congratulate themselves on anticipating the

                    possible that some syllogisms may be real, and others not real but only
                    apparent, there must also be real and apparent enthymemes, since the enthymeme
                    is a kind of syllogism.

                    that of diction, which is of two kinds. The first, as in Dialectic, consists in
                    ending with a conclusion syllogistically expressed, although there has been no
                    syllogistic process, “therefore it is neither this nor
                    that,” “so it must be this or that”; and similarly
                    in rhetorical arguments a concise and antithetical statement is supposed to be
                    an enthymeme; for such a style appears to contain a real enthymeme. This fallacy
                    appears to be the result of the form of expression. For the purpose of using the
                    diction to create an impression of syllogistic reasoning it is useful to state
                    the heads of several syllogisms: “He saved some, avenged others, and
                    freed the Greeks”;

                    other, especially by politicians. Thus, Demades declared that the policy of

                    apparent syllogism arises as the result of considering a thing first absolutely,
                    and then not absolutely, but only in a particular case. For instance, in
                    Dialectic, it is argued that that which is not <emph>is</emph>, for that which
                    is not <emph>is</emph> that which is not<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The
                        first “is” means “has a real, absolute
                        existence”; the second “is” merely expresses
                        the identity of the terms of the proposition, and is particular; but the
                        sophistical reasoner takes it in the same sense as the first. The same
                        applies to the argument about the unknown.</note>; also, that the unknown
                    can be known, for it can be known of the unknown that it is unknown. Similarly,
                    in Rhetoric, an apparent enthymeme may arise from that which is not absolutely
                    probable but only in particular cases. But this is not to be understood
                    absolutely, as Agathon says:

                            <l>One might perhaps say that this very thing is probable, that many

                    for that which is contrary to probability nevertheless does happen, so
                    that that which is contrary to probability is probable. If this is so, that
                    which is improbable will be probable. But not absolutely; but as, in the case of
                    sophistical disputations, the argument becomes fallacious when the
                    circumstances, reference, and manner are not added, so here it will become so
                    owing to the probability being not probable absolutely but only in particular
                    cases.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The “Art” of Corax
                    is composed of this topic. For if a man is not likely to be guilty of what he is
                    accused of, for instance if, being weak, he is accused of assault and battery,
                    his defence will be that the crime is not probable; but if he is likely to be
                    guilty, for instance,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>if he is strong, it may be argued
                    again that the crime is not probable, for the very reason that it was bound to
                    appear so. It is the same in all other cases; for a man must either be likely to
                    have committed a crime or not. Here, both the alternatives appear equally
                    probable, but the one is really so, the other not probable absolutely, but only
                    in the conditions mentioned. And this is what “making the worse appear
                    the better argument” means. Wherefore men were justly disgusted with
                    the promise of Protagoras<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">This utterance of
                        Protagoras gave particular offense as apparently implying that the weaker
                        cause was really identical with the worse, so that to support it was to
                        support injustice. But, considering the high moral character ascribed to
                        Protagoras, it seems more probable to take the formula as a statement of the
                        aim of all ancient orators—how to overcome stronger arguments by
                        arguments weaker in themselves.</note>; for it is a lie, not a real but an
                    apparent probability, not found in any art except Rhetoric and Sophistic. So
                    much for real or apparent enthymemes.

                    objection from what is contrary is brought if, for instance, the enthymeme is
                    that the good man does good to all his friends; it may be objected: But the bad
                    man does not do harm [to all his friends].

                    kind of objection is derived from the former decisions of
                    well-known men. For instance, if the enthymeme is that one should make allowance

                    they may be refuted in the same manner as probabilities. For if we have a single
                    fact that contradicts the opponent's example, the argument is refuted as not
                    being necessary, even though examples, more in number and of more common
                    occurrence, are otherwise<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">On the other side,

                    of examples is on the side of the opponent, we must contend either that the
                    present example is not similar to those cited by him, or that the thing did not
                    take place in the same way, or that there is some difference.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But
                    necessary signs and the enthymemes derived from
                    them cannot be refuted on the ground of not furnishing a logical conclusion, as
                    is clear from the

                    alleged is non-existent. But if it is evident that it is true and that it is a
                    necessary sign, the argument at once becomes irrefutable; for, by means of
                    demonstration, everything at once becomes clear.

                    and depreciation are not elements of enthymeme （for I regard element

                    a head under which several enthymemes are included, but they are enthymemes

                    and enthymemes; so that if none of these is a topic of enthymeme, neither is
                    amplification or depreciation.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nor are
                    enthymemes by which arguments are refuted of a different kind from those by
                    which they are established; for it is clear that demonstration or bringing an
                    objection is the means of refutation. By the first the contrary of the
                    adversary's conclusion is demonstrated; for instance, if he has shown that a
                    thing has happened, his opponent shows that it has not; if he has shown that a
                    thing has not happened, he shows that it has. This, therefore, will not be the
                    difference between them; for both employ the same arguments; they bring forward
                    enthymemes to show that the thing is or that it is not.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And the
                    objection is not an enthymeme, but, as I said
                    in the <title>Topics</title>, it is stating an opinion which is intended to make
                    it clear that the adversary's syllogism is not logical, or that he has assumed
                    some false premise.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now, since there are three
